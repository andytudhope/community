Brown</td> <td align=left>Hello everyone. Welcome to the March 28<sup>th</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. It also coincidentally is our 28<sup>th</sup> meeting, so that's a lot of meetings. We've gone over a lot. I think that we're in a good place, so I continue to look forward to these all week. I think there's some interesting stuff that we're going to be able to tackle today as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000023>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h00m23s">00:00:23</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Preamble of course is that we are very, very, very interested in soliciting as much information as we can from the community. You guys are all enormously smart and plugged in people. We need to get your feedback. So if you have a question or you have a comment, don't wait for an opening, just type it into the chat, if you don't have a microphone, or interrupt if you do have a microphone.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000047>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h00m47s">00:00:47</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>The conversations are heating up a bit, very energetic, very passionate. That's great. Also, one thing I want to do is that if you're having, if you have a question you want have answered or you want to become part of the greater discussion and you ask in the chats, we'll make an effort to bring that into the main conversation because I want to try to avoid a situation where we have furiously interesting debates happening in the chat while there's a furiously interesting debate happening in the same call. So I want to try and sync those things up so we're all on the same page.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000119>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h01m19s">00:01:19</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So if you have something to say, make sure that we know and one then we'll either ask you about it or you can have the opportunity to tell us about it. I think that is it for my preambles today. I'm sure I'll remember something in the next five minutes, but that's all I got. So Stephen, I'm going to hand this over to you so you can set the set the agenda form.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000138>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h01m38s">00:01:38</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Sure. Firstly, welcome everybody and thank you very much for for joining this call. Also an expression of gratitude with so many folks in the community that are actually contributing towards the analysis, contributing data. It is very much appreciated. So please keep that coming.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000156>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h01m56s">00:01:56</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>To that end, I just want to reiterate a few things. The first is the themes that we want to cover in these meetings. As you know, the first one is the demand and supply [inaudible 00:02:07] what do we think about that? How do we measure it and what are the considerations?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000212>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h02m12s">00:02:12</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>The second theme, which we'll obviously start getting into either today or even a later time is collateral types, the collateral portfolio and obviously the parameter adjustments and calculations around that. And then the third theme is basically exogenous risks. These are the three themes that I think we should continually try to focus on as they actually do cover the broad spectrum of the decentralized risk in the scientific governance principles.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000241>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h02m41s">00:02:41</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Now. So the theme today that we're going to obviously remain focused on surprise, surprise is the demand, supply and balance. And we're going to have a look at the metrics around that and see what sort of insights we can gather from that, but please remember this is a decentralized scientific governance and this is a discussion about the stability fee, which are basically considered and facilitated by the MakerDAO Foundation, which is just yet another community member and more so a nonvoting community member.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000313>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h03m13s">00:03:13</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>And what we ultimately want to do is put these things forward so that the decision can be made by the MKR governance.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000320>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h03m20s">00:03:20</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Again, also keep in mind about continuous approval voting. The essence of this is that you always need to be aware what's going on, so please be involved as much as possible. That being said, I'm going to end my short monologue and hand it back over.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000339>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h03m39s">00:03:39</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>All right, thank you, Stephen. We have, we're in a situation where we could talk to risk. We have a few speeches and stuff, but I want to make sure that this conversation stays as targeted as it possibly can while giving everybody in the call an opportunity to sound off a bit more than we had in the last few calls because there's been a lot to go over. So I'm not going to monopolize five or 10 minutes of the meeting. I want to hand it off to Cyrus almost immediately to give us the update from the risk team.

I mean in some respects, not even close. We're just still hovering in the 97.5 to low 98 range. Pretty consistent. I will say that one thing that we noticed this week was less variance, although not technically at the price that you'd like to see. You saw a lot less volatility and a lot less kind of trader panic or whatever or speculation as you might want to call it. And you know this is not surprising. It's actually something that at least slightly we are happy to see in the sense that we obviously we raised the stability fee to 7.5 percent and it definitely had impacts in other areas.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000602>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h06m02s">00:06:02</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>I'll flip back to this chart in a moment, but main thing that we saw this week that I want to highlight are these pink bars over here, which is we saw some significant, you saw some significant CDP closures, the total Dai supply, you know, reduced from an all time high of 95 million down to its current 88 million.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000627>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h06m27s">00:06:27</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>There's a few different things we can glean from this information. First is that this effect is still going on. I would, my opinion, we haven't really seen the effect fully play out. We saw some decent wipe activity in the last few days. So you know, this was obviously a larger than normal increase in instability fee.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000657>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h06m57s">00:06:57</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Yeah, I mean 7 million is a fairly large amount of Dai that was wiped down. Very informal chain analysis revealed that if I had to guess it was basically market making activities from box or whomever that was maybe taking advantage of kind of cheap capital to deploy strategies at 7.5 percent stability fee. Not entirely likely that they were able to turn a profit in their estimation. So we saw a few very large CDPs close, I think about a million each.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000745>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h07m45s">00:07:45</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>So yeah. So what does this mean for the Dai price? You know, the Dai price is obviously not at a dollar. As far as I'm aware, general market maker inventories are roughly the same. I'll have Joe chime in and a bit on that and whoever else. But you know, I think it's important to note that there was still a positive impact in other senses, namely that the liquidity that you might've expected to stand in the way of a rally back to a dollar is now significantly lessened.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000827>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h08m27s">00:08:27</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>When we finally start to see more retail CDP start to repurchase Dai to close out their CDPs it will see much more rapid appreciation to $1. What this all means for the stability fee going forward, obviously an open question and something I'm sure we will be discussing that for the remainder of this call. So yeah this is more of a longterm picture kind of over the last month. I mean it's not entirely clear from this chart, but we definitely saw significantly lesser volatility in the Dai price in the last week compared to what we'd seen early on in March. All right. That's it for now. I'm going to pass it to Joe if you want to say anything or any of the other market makers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000928>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h09m28s">00:09:28</a></td> <td align=left>Joe Quintilian</td> <td align=left>Thanks Cyrus. Yeah, I'm just talk about one thing. The volume and volatility are down tremendously and I think Cyrus, you're 100% right on that. I have seen some solid, when we moved to 7.5%, saw a lot of market makers come in with solid bids and felt more confident in the bidding like 98 cents, 98.5 cents, this is over the counter. But still a lot of, especially on the exchanges, these decentralized exchanges, there's still not, the volume is falling off a cliff. So it's also overall volumes in terms of the mark- in terms of ETH pricing, volatility, that volatility is coming a lot too. So I think we made the right move so far and we'll see how this effect happens over the next week or so.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001026>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h10m26s">00:10:26</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I guess I want to jump in with a question. So I think I'm still wrestling with what do people do with Dai and it seems like an elementary question, but I'm looking for any kind of an indication here. And so Cyrus, you said that it could be assumed that the people that are most immediately hit by this kind of thing are market makers with bots, people that are running bots and with the decrease in volume, is that, does that support that theory? That these volume numbers we've been seeing in the past are largely related to bots on the chain?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001103>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h11m03s">00:11:03</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>I mean maybe orthogonally in the sense that, I mean, the Dai market makers aren't impacting overall crypto volume one way or another. But in terms of which exchanges we saw the Dai being pulled from, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw less Dai volume on those particular exchanges. Does that make sense?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001127>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h11m27s">00:11:27</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Yeah.

I understand that if you hold Ether and if you have a CDP, you are on the speculator side.

So right now I'm just gonna throw out some stuff. You know, Dharma Lever is offering 6% Compound finance is offering 3 - 4%, Expo trading, they were keeping a lot of their interest a secret, but they can't find enough lenders so they can't find enough people that are offering Dai, they're going to raise their interest rate for the next contract that opens in two days and it's, look, it's going to be 10%. 10% interest APR on Dai.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001243>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h12m43s">00:12:43</a></td> <td align=left>Aviv Milner</td> <td align=left>And they're maxing out right now at about 200,000 Dai being lent.

And there's another company that just came out, which I forget their name, but they're doing exactly what dYdX is doing. Someone wrote about it and the Maker chat. So I feel like there needs to be an entire kind of like speculation page, but for people like myself who are trying to find the best interest rate and who are trying to capitalize on the fact that interest rates are going up. So I'll throw up the link for Expo right now in the chat. It's expotrading.com/lend.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001322>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h13m22s">00:13:22</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>That's interesting. It's something that I think that we're just waiting for somebody to find that niche, right? I think that LoanScan might be moving in that direction to find out, to just be a marketplace for the best rates. And it also reminds me of something Mateo has been writing some excellent articles. And so I'm not sure whether as a journalist you're comfortable with being a part of the conversation that you're reporting on, but you mentioned in your last article on the blog about a DIPOR which I think kind of aligns with one of the things that Aviv is talking about.

Or did you want to sit this one out?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001357>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h13m57s">00:13:57</a></td> <td align=left>Matteo Leibowitz</td> <td align=left>Sure. Can you guys hear me all right? Great. So yeah. DIPOR is this term Decentralized Inter-Protocol Offer Rate. And it's a kind of riff off of libel. And the idea is that on these government schools you can actually use DIPORs as some kind of reference metric to assess the effect that a stability fee hike or decrease has had on the wider Dai economy. So if DIPOR is relatively low, the borrow rates are relatively low, then that might signify that the stability fee needs to be hiked because there's still a lot of supply on the market and conversely, once DIPOR starts to rise, you can tell that the stability fee has has had its effect. Possibly it might be worth then reducing the stability fee.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001503>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h15m03s">00:15:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Yeah, I think that's an amazing concept.

But over time as we start to see more liquidity and more aggregate liquidity across these platforms, it could be a pretty powerful metric, and a metric that would accompany something like a market maker inventory as well. So just help us make these kinds of informed decisions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001548>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h15m48s">00:15:48</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Yeah, I love it.

There's this huge section of collateral risk, which is actually for those of you who have been around for a while, was kind of the primary focus of this call week in and week out, up until a few months ago when the Dai peg started to kind of take precedence. It's a more pressing manner. So I think going forward we're going to try to maybe either divide these calls into two parts or maybe just devote a little bit of time to talking about each section. Over time we may even see these calls kind of split up into two, one for collateral risk, one for monetary policy type of stuff.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001755>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h17m55s">00:17:55</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>We'll see.

Some of you may not be familiar with this term, the decentralized risk function. So this kind of embodies how we are approaching risk as a Dao.

One is, the main one in my view is specialization. I think it's not feasible that one risk team can manage the entirety of the system. If you can imagine the kind of work that goes into deciding the monetary policy, dealing with various collateral assets, managing risk parameters, kind of maintenance in the system overall, not really feasible that one team can kind of handle everything. So I think the longterm goal is to see specialized risk teams that they have a particular interest in a particular asset class and they will be coming in and working on a specific aspect.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002047>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h20m47s">00:20:47</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Another benefit of having a structure is that we can sort of get rid of any subjectivity. If you have multiple risk teams looking at, for example, what the stability fee for [inaudible 00:21:00] should be, then you can start to think maybe we can take a blend of the recommendations from different risk teams or obviously can hope to get rid of any biases.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002118>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h21m18s">00:21:18</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Decentralized risk teams will obviously kind of ensure that hopefully someone is always working, someone is always watching over the system and working towards managing risk. And I think there'll be somewhat of a competitive environment in that there'll be some sort of reputation or status to be earned by being the risk team that will ultimately be chosen for submitting risk parameters. So I imagine that there will be some compensatory advantages of being a good risk manager.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002152>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h21m52s">00:21:52</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>So let's go back to the overview. So there's primarily three kind of broad aspects of risk. In my mind the main one is the collateral portfolio, which comprises of a qualitative framework where you dig into the asset, its qualities, the team, the organization, the technology, everything that has to do with the qualitative side of things.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002219>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h22m19s">00:22:19</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>And then there is quantitative aspect to it where we'll be looking at basically the trading profile, liquidity, exchanges, things that factor into how we would determine its suitability for collateral auctions. Obviously, illiquid assets for example, would have to be dealt with differently. Second big class is monetary policy, which we've been doing for the past few months now is very data analytics heavy, teams that are proficient in statistics, econometrics, all that kind of stuff. And then finally we have kind of</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002301>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h23m01s">00:23:01</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Then finally, we have kind of a class of technical risks in relation to oracles options, integrations, that kind of stuff. Interesting thing that a lot of people don't think about for auctions, for example, is the length of these auctions. Right now for single collateral we just have the 3% mark down, but obviously for multi collateral we'll be shifting from an option structure. I'm sure there's, there's very deep game theoretic considerations behind auctions and different assets with different liquidity profiles would require a different structure. So you know, I could imagine just a ton of risk work being done just purely on auction structure.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002358>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h23m58s">00:23:58</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>For today's call, I kind of want of just ... or at least for the rest of this presentation, focus on the qualitative framework and what that entails.

So what are the goals of the qualitative framework? These are kind of what I've pegged to be the most important things that we'd like to see coming out and make our risk teams. Number one is that it is comprehensive, that we leave no stone unturned. Basically for anyone who's spent any significant amount of time investing or trading in the space it's just a never ending grind to figure out what's really going on behind a lot of these organizations. There's always some interesting edge cases when it comes to examining the crypto space. We have a principle here being scientific in our, in our governance obviously logical reasons, sound explanations, something that is hopefully not just opinion based. You want to keep this framework standardized so that as different risk teams kind of compete to be chosen as the lead risk team becomes easy to benchmark teams against each other.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002533>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h25m33s">00:25:33</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>The final two are, so I mean, eventually we're going to have to tackle the notion of how we're going to scale, just adding parameters. If we have hundreds or thousands of collateral types being added, there's going to need to be some sort of some sort of queue, some sort of filtering mechanism where we are able to kind of prioritize which collateral types we want to see in ASAP.

I think it's a sensible approach of dealing with the risk is kind of looking at things from a top down and a bottom up approach. Top down is classification of assets, utility tokens versus work tokens versus money tokens or whatever. Basically we need to understand what these tokens look like, what they represent, in order to understand the risks behind them. A very standard example, utility token and some tokenized security it's not going to have the same risk profile by any means, you know? So once we've done a broad classification, we can then, obviously, dive into the, the core of the organization and everything that it represents.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002758>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h27m58s">00:27:58</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>That's about it.

So it'd be like a sort of a one off kind of thing or it's going to be more of a subscription type of deal? Or is it, I guess it doesn't have to be binary, right?

The data that they provide for the other risk team members can also be vetted by them. So in the beginning I can imagine them saying, "Well we've done this work, here it is for you." It's either something that is just a small subsection of what they do in general or it is something that perhaps they focus their entire team on.

It's not going to be a complete economic or business model, but it's one that's going to have to bootstrap along with the system. So being here first, getting a good sense of what's going on and being able to support this, this function, appropriately is going to be beneficial because when you do crack that big number, when you do go through that massive ceiling of supply, that's when it's going to be very clear as to what can possibly be compensated and to what level.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003233>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h32m33s">00:32:33</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>That's the other, to through another spinner in the works that there seems like there's this room here for an organization that has significant Maker holdings would be doing a risk type functions just simply to protect their own investments, because it's in their own best interest to make sure that the community has the the clearest and most accurate information.

The same way that governance can create its own economic world as well.

So there is this wonderful integration that if a risk team can see and contributes, they will know that once you get us to critical point, a critical juncture, you can go from your sort of free model into your premium model.

There's two aspects to this that we need to keep in mind. The first is that we are using a risk tooling that is in the traditional space. In the traditional space the breadth and depth of it is massive, so it's not like you can come out and decide that we're going to use the astrological process of the stars to dictate what collateral we're going to use. Even though it might be a wonderful idea, and I know there's some traders that do that unfortunately won't fit into that sense of scientific rigor that has been formulated appropriately in the traditional space from which we're borrowing. So there is going to be a very clearly defined necessity for not only rigor but reproducible research as well. That's something I need to emphasize. To be able to say, this is the model and these are the parameters we get.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003702>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h37m02s">00:37:02</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>"Trust me" is not enough. It's more a case of these are the models and making it publicly available. That's where I've got the data from. This is how I did my calculation go ahead and do the same thing. You should get exactly the same figure. That allows us to sidestep folks who wanted to scream the loudest about how good their models are, or it also sidesteps the issues that you might have folks that have very complicated models and they're very hard to digest and it's very hard to reproduce, but they may be entirely correct.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003734>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h37m34s">00:37:34</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>We have to also make sure that there's attractability there that is understood clearly in terms of its practical use in the system. So there's various aspects of this that is very open to a critical debate in terms of its usefulness and this especially benchmarked against the traditional world. So we're not coming in from the cold, sort of just devising an all kinds of new methods. We can actually use that which is readily available.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003803>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h38m03s">00:38:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Great. I'm going to move on to the next question. So Jordan asks, will there be a risk team to make sure all of the collateral pools are playing nicely together? Could the DGX-focussed risk team say, "We think we should do X," but then the foundation says, "I get that's the best thing for you, but we need your team to push the peg up." So this is an interesting question about how does the portfolio interact with itself and the other members of the collateral pool. So Cyrus or Steven, did you want to pick that one up?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003832>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h38m32s">00:38:32</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Sure, I'll take a stab at it. Yeah, I think managing the overall collateral pool is a sufficiently complex tasks that it requires its own risk team. So in a certain sense, for example a DGX-focused risk team would do a very deep dive into organization and submit parameters based on its qualitative specifications. But there has to be, there has to be another risk team that is managing the overall pool, making sure that everything plays nicely together and that team cannot also be doing a deep dive into every single organization in the cloud. I mean, if it gets into the high numbers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003915>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h39m15s">00:39:15</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>So yeah, my opinion is that yeah. In fact arguably they're the most important risk team in a sense that they're managing the cross-correlations between different asset classes. I mean DGX focused risk team may or may not be aware that there's already a certain level of exposure to gold, for example, elsewhere in the collateral pool. May or may not be in their purview, but definitely should be something that a separate risk team is managing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003952>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h39m52s">00:39:52</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>All right. I'm hoping that answers Jordan's questions. This is part of the interesting thing about the risk teams, interesting from the outside perspective because I kind of feel for you guys. The complexity of this thing as it grows over time is sort of mind boggling. The part that I keep on coming back to even managing a portfolio that you have absolute control over the inputs and the outputs is a nontrivial exercise. But in this model, those inputs and outputs aren't necessarily under the founder or the risk team's control. So it's going to be fascinating to watch and I think it's going to be one of the primary focuses of a great number of people just to maintain the assets themselves behind the scenes. I can't wait to see this thing develop.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004040>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h40m40s">00:40:40</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I want to open up the discussion here because we have a tendency to do a huge data dump and these things that we have it very targeted discussion over.

Develops into a governance poll which leads into an executive votes, our governance poll, which leads to the next call where we discussed the results of that and then on that Friday we have an executive vote.

Even if we estimate it, we need to just have what we ... even throwing out a number of thinking that the demand is X and if obviously the more supporting data behind it, the better. But so much of our, how we get to the Peg is derived around the equilibrium of getting supply and demand more or less to match.

If they were all affected in a way that's predictable, then I think that we might be onto something. It would help us to understand exactly what's happening.

But until we at least throw out an number and quantify it and then have support which will be a work in progress for the next year or years to come to that conclusion.

It's the demand part that that's still a question mark. Until we understand what the demand is, is the demand levering up? Is the demand collateral-type for a other lending platforms? Then what percentage of that demand is actually organic usage in the ecosystem? Which is still early days. So I think the answer to that question three is going to be depressingly small for the near future, but it's me to figure it out.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004533>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h45m33s">00:45:33</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Akiva have brought up an interesting point, are We discussing The Peg today?

I mean, stability fee and collateralization ratio, can kind of think of it as inverses, I mean points on a curve where you can kind of adjust one or the other to get to the same point. As far as kind of user experience goes, I think changing collateral requirements would be much more unfriendly for having the same ultimate impact.

As an example of debt ceiling, a way to think about this is imagine you had one single CDP. What is the maximum amount of collateral you'd like to have deposited given that you wish to liquidate it over a given time period. So, that's how you answer the first question about debt ceiling. Then the second one, about liquidation ratio, that is very much related to obviously online volatility of the asset itself. That speaks to what the liquidation ratio should be. Then, of course, you have what's leftover is the stability fee. Now if you take everything else out of the equation then the stability fee would generally be very small because it should be able to cover the economic cost of... [inaudible]</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005019>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h50m19s">00:50:19</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>In the stability fee you've got these components, if you recall. And those components are ... [inaudible] that has a fourth component called liquidity premium.

First, to cover the cost of running an operation, but also at the same time to act as a policy instrument. That's why you wanna use the stability fee specifically. You can, if you wish, change the others and create a policy component in there as well, but then what you do is you create permutations and that creates complexity.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005116>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h51m16s">00:51:16</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>It kind of needs to first come from the first principal basis of understanding what debt ceiling is truly supposed to achieve and that is always in the context of the whole system is robust. Everything is moving forward full bull and it's working perfectly. As opposed to where we are now where we're seeing things are bootstrapping. As an example, if you have a debt ceiling of lets say, $15 million on token ABC and the whole DeFi space is robust, everything's moving forward appropriately, what you're basically saying is that if you've hit that debt ceiling, you need to go find more collateral types.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005159>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h51m59s">00:51:59</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>There isn't this option of increasing it anymore because your risk parameters have definitively concluded that anything above that is a risk to the system that we cannot and we do not wish to bear. Where we are right now in bootstrapping, we are slowly getting to these true debt ceilings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005220>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h52m20s">00:52:20</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Keeping that in mind, there is this option to think, whilst bootstrapping, why not just use the debt ceiling as part of this mechanism? You could, but then you're working against the general ethos of why it was there in the first place. If you have a look at the liquidation ratio, then you're basically actually, all you're doing is literally transferring the risk out of the stability fee into the liquidation ratio.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005242>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h52m42s">00:52:42</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>The risk profile as a whole stays the same to Cyrus' point, but if you start attributing it to different risk parameters, you just create a little bit of a complexity that's very difficult to manage. That's why the stability fee is the best place to deal with this particular risk and to also deal with this particular dislocation, because it aligns appropriately. An increase in stability fee both affects the supply and demand function. A decrease has the opposite effect, both in the supply and demand functions. It does have a coherent and complete functionality that is appropriately incentivized, just by using stability fee.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005332>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h53m32s">00:53:32</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Okay, that's clear enough for me.

We need to, we're still feeling out those complexities, but I think that that's going to be a core component of these calls in the future. Some easy way, whether it's just liquidity providers giving us a thumbs up emoji or a thumbs down emoji, or whether we have a very sophisticated snark space tool where people could submit their numbers and we can try and verify it that way.

I don't know who brought it up about DIPOR, based DIPOR. Basically using the idea of LIPOR in the decentralized space. That is the essence of it too to Jesse's question. We are literally asking all liquidity providers to come in, but you know, they need to be incentivized appropriately to contribute what they know. We're trying to align that incentive by simply saying keep in mind that if you state clearly what your position is, then you can also state clearly what you'd like to see the stability fee as, as a contributing member.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005543>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h55m43s">00:55:43</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>It's not going to be terribly unclear as to why they want it. If you got what you consider to be high inventory, you may propose a very large stability fee, then it's just a case of going, yeah well we know why you want the large stability fee, but at the same time, we need to just gage how, gage the level that you're proposing. Maybe pull it back a little bit. Maybe control it from everyone else's point of view. That is essentially the premise of this kind of liable proposition where you do have decentralized contributions where you clearly know where the incentives lie in those contributions and submissions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005626>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=00h56m26s">00:56:26</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Alright.

Yeah, we'd love to see that token, but we're not in the business of chasing people down for 1/100<sup>th</sup> of their condo so we can liquidate their CDP.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010304>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=01h03m04s">01:03:04</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>Right.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010306>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=01h03m06s">01:03:06</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>It's fantastically complicated.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010309>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=01h03m09s">01:03:09</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>I'm not, the risk teams you guys were talking about.

Maker risk teams look like and what their roles are and how they would interact with the community, the foundation if they need to do that, or compensation, all that stuff. I mean, the thing is, a lot of it is still kind of somewhat of a work in progress. I mean, when I say work, I mean, there hasn't, some decisions haven't been finalized yet on how we think the best way it could go about it. But I mean it really doesn't even matter what we think is the best way. I mean, a risk team ultimately either very unlikely, does work for free, just out of whatever, and they can submit risk work, or they somehow apply with MKR holder. Somehow you could create some sort of communication meeting where they can interact directly with some [inaudible] group of MKR token holders and go through there.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010426>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=01h04m26s">01:04:26</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>Yeah, I guess we'll follow up off the call.

So I think that part of the process of figuring out how that process works will involve heavy amounts of input from people that are interested in risk teams. I think that for a lot of this stuff, we're going to be looking to people like you Barron or to other people who are interested in eventually spawning off their own teams, and work on that process together.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010501>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=01h05m01s">01:05:01</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>Yeah, definitely. I mean I was foreseeing something like we would build an algorithm, approach to assessing risk and collateral parametrization for those risk parameters. That could be something that's developed on chain where people would submit something that we can pull an on chain price history for, look at the volatility, look at things like the [inaudible 01:05:21] spreads and exchange availability, and basically set kind of like, it doesn't necessarily have to be like a machine learning algorithm, but a trained algorithm to assess what those risk parameters, on a very conservative basis, would need to start out as, and then improve over time. So it wouldn't need as much manual oversight and can be done more seamlessly over time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010543>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA7VC22134&t=01h05m43s">01:05:43</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I think the most exciting for anybody's who's considering starting a risk team, or taking over some kind of risk function is the fact that there's literally no shortage of low hanging fruit here. So anybody who's interested can jump in and immediately begin to contribute in a meaningful way. I'm kind of, in crypto, every once in awhile, I realize that I'm in the wrong job. Risk is enormously fascinating to me, so I'm super keen on watching how this thing shakes up.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </article> </div> </div> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-footer-copyright> Made with <a href=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ target=_blank rel=noopener> Material for MkDocs </a> </div> <div class=md-footer-social> <a href=https://github.com/maker/community target=_blank rel=noopener title=github.com class=md-footer-social__link> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 496 512"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"/></svg> </a> <a href=https://twitter.com/MakerDAO target=_blank rel=noopener title=twitter.com class=md-footer-social__link> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M459.37 151.716c.325 4.548.325 9.097.325 13.645 0 138.72-105.583 298.558-298.558 298.558-59.452 0-114.68-17.219-161.137-47.106 8.447.974 16.568 1.299 25.34 1.299 49.055 0 94.213-16.568 130.274-44.832-46.132-.975-84.792-31.188-98.112-72.772 6.498.974 12.995 1.624 19.818 1.624 9.421 0 18.843-1.3 27.614-3.573-48.081-9.747-84.143-51.98-84.143-102.985v-1.299c13.969 7.797 30.214 12.67 47.431 13.319-28.264-18.843-46.781-51.005-46.781-87.391 0-19.492 5.197-37.36 14.294-52.954 51.655 63.675 129.3 105.258 216.365 109.807-1.624-7.797-2.599-15.918-2.599-24.04 0-57.828 46.782-104.934 104.934-104.934 30.213 0 57.502 12.67 76.67 33.137 23.715-4.548 46.456-13.32 66.599-25.34-7.798 24.366-24.366 44.833-46.132 57.827 21.117-2.273 41.584-8.122 60.426-16.243-14.292 20.791-32.161 39.308-52.628 54.253z"/></svg> </a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src=../../../../assets/javascripts/vendor.241d0c29.min.js></script> <script src=../../../../assets/javascripts/bundle.05dbdb2b.min.js></script><script id=__lang type=application/json>{"search.config.lang": "en", "clipboard.copy": "Copy to clipboard", "search.result.none": "No matching documents", "search.result.other": "# matching documents", "search.config.separator": "[\\s\\-]+", "search.result.placeholder": "Type to start searching", "search.config.pipeline": "trimmer, stopWordFilter", "clipboard.copied": "Copied to clipboard", "search.result.one": "1 matching document"}</script> <script>
