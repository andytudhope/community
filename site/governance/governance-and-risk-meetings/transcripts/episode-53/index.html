Welcome to the September 19<sup>th</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting at MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I am the head of community development at Maker and the... I forgot. I'm also the interim governance facilitator. Right. I guess I should add that to my resume.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000023></a><a href=#000023>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h00m23s">00:00:23</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Today, we are going to mix up the agenda slightly. We have some conflicts that we need to route around. We also have some special guests and this is going to be fairly exciting because we have some heavyweights in the room today. Fluidity is here and they're going to talk about their Tokenized Asset Portfolio mechanism that they released to the community. There was a blog post that went out recently, a paper that went out. There was some very high level discussions that went along with that post. In my mind, not enough discussions, so, because it was worthy of more investigation than it received, and so hopefully we can dig into some of the details today.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000059></a><a href=#000059>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h00m59s">00:00:59</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We have a fairly committed and fairly smart crowd here, so I'm looking forward to the questions we might get. I am going to skip governance until, like I said, the second half of the call. We'll start off with risk and then ... But before we get into that, let's talk about the standard preambles that we've all heard 53 times before, if you're an active listener.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000121></a><a href=#000121>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h01m21s">00:01:21</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We are intensely interested in dealing with issues in the community and answering questions as they arise and hearing what this group is interested in, what it's been up to. So if you have a question or a comment, please feel free to interrupt us. If you have a microphone, just jump right in and ask your questions. If you do not have a microphone, find wherever the button happens to be on the UX that you're looking at, type your question into the side. David or I or someone else will find that question and we'll read it out for you.

I'll actually start with this. The highlight is, DAI supply is up a fairly significant amount. Collateral value locked also at a reasonable level. But the main thing is that some refinancing, some just re-uptick in activity given what's been going on lately with ETH price. You know, we kind of called this shot in the sense that as the stability fees lowered, if ETH price is doing reasonably or people are feeling reasonably bullish, you will see sort of this re-uptick in leveraging activity.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000404></a><a href=#000404>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h04m04s">00:04:04</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Good news is, it's not been so much just a tremendous amount of risk with very little collateral added; it's been kind of a little bit of both. So we're just sort of recovering some of that lost interest in CDP activity before. So overall, I think a rather positive week is a good way of looking at it. What's really interesting is, this happened without sort of crashing DAI, which you know ...

So it looked like about 63,000 ETH. So keeping the collateralization ratio roughly ... overall, for the system, around 350%, which is a pretty reasonable level. As far as longterm trends, so basically, it's a very short timeframe blip, so it's not really going to show in the longterm trends just yet. But essentially, the pace of the amount of DAI being locked has started to tick back up again so we can keep an eye on that, and the amount of collateral being freed, still pretty flat.

That's what you expect when you see more of that leveraging behavior.

And so actually, that weighted average borrow rate for dYdX and Compound was above that stability fee, which meant that it was cheaper to open your positions on Maker during that timeframe, which is fascinating when that happens.

So yes, as far as the refinancing, but that was how it happened the first time as well, right? So we saw ... when there was that, you know, uptick in activity on Compound through InstaDApp and a large amount of refinancings from MKR to Compound. About four and a half million moved in one day, primarily through one or two large positions.

And one of the things that we've noticed that could be major challenges to that are ... the two main things are the oracles that will be needed to monitor the price and position data for any assets that's introduced, and also, all the mechanisms that are in place to ensure that the liquidation process can occur seamlessly, and that keepers are ensured that they're going to get the proceeds of their liquidations.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001641></a><a href=#001641>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h16m41s">00:16:41</a></td> <td>Britton Overall</td> <td>So we introduced the Tokenized Asset Portfolio as a way to help solve that, and what that is is essentially a structure that covers both the legal operational tech and it brings together one framework to be able to introduce that asset into the ecosystem and for that asset to be used throughout the process.

And then we went through the process of withdrawing the DAI. So we returned the test DAI and closed out the CDP, and then sold the treasuries and burned those tokens.

So this is Jeff. So maybe I'll just briefly walk through some of the legal mechanics, both in the version that we set out in July and then some of the kind of revisions that we've made since then. So it's critical, in our view, in introducing synthetic assets, to ensure a few things.

And assuming that Fluidity is in the picture, is solvent, then we'll happily just simply, return an equivalent amount of DAI for every token that's deposited. The trust mechanism that I just described is really a last resort, and that's simply there in the event that Fluidity is no longer in the picture and the keepers need some way to get value back for the tokens that they purchased. Because it's a regulated trust entity, they're going to need to do regular way KYC on the participants who are bringing that token back.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002821></a><a href=#002821>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h28m21s">00:28:21</a></td> <td>Jeff Amico</td> <td>And so any transaction would need to comply with applicable laws that they're subject to, but we don't really envision that materially restricting the type of people who could bring a token back, so long as they weren't sanctioned or on any sort of traditional AML lists that would restrict our trust from transacting with them.

As Jeff mentioned, part of the process in liquidation would involve the keeper bringing the token to Fluidity or the trust that would then be able to provide them with DAI or USD in return for that token. That presumes that that entity, either the sponsor Fluidity, or the trust was able to liquidate the underlying collateral. We think that treasuries... We have a slide on this in a little bit, we think that treasuries are in fact one of the most liquid assets, the market depth for treasuries is enormous. And so we think that it would be very feasible for any sort of entity that needs to liquidate the underlying assets to do so in a very timely fashion.

I think that it's ultimately a balance between reducing intermediaries and potentially, as you mentioned, increasing margins, but also on the other hand, using a system that is robust and kind of can maintain the integrity of the DAI system even in the event of a liquidation. And so the introduction of things like custodians and trusts, while perhaps not optimal from a margin perspective, I think is ultimately necessary perhaps for the entirety of the synthetic asset segment, but certainly at least for something like this in our opinion, to really give the system assurance that in the event that a CDP, that was backed by an asset like this liquidated, that the keepers would be made whole. And it really kind of, the introduction of those intermediaries is designed to eliminate some of the counterparty risk that is inherent to introducing synthetic assets.

And we had taken a look through that and it was really comprehensive, it really helped guide a lot of the questions that we needed to ask ourselves in that process. But one thing that we noticed was that there were some some room for improvement after we'd gone through the process that we thought could be added for synthetic assets, and some important questions that we thought could be raised there. I'm posting a link in the group chat to a post that we did actually this morning about some of these additions that we are proposing for that, and we really bucketed these into three categories. One is around the risks that the particular asset is introducing, and some of the considerations that would be needed there to make sure that a particular asset is not too risky for the Maker system. The second is Oracles, so it's very important that any asset that gets introduced, that the position or that asset is held, can be confirmed. And then also that there is a data feed that has accurate pricing to know the value of that asset at any time, to make sure that it's falling within the collaterization ratio and the system as a whole is collateralized, and then all of that data is available. The third is liquidation, and I know we spent some time already talking about that, but the right structure needs to be in place for that to make sure that all of the scenarios that could happen in that process are buttoned up and the right mechanics are there, legal rights are in place. So we've posted some questions we could probably flip over just to show the post, won't go into all the details but essentially everything is the same on the tech section and the original financial section. We've added some other items which can be seen there in bold that we think are some additional questions that we might want to ask if there are other synthetic assets that are introduced. So feel free to take a look there, we welcome any feedback from the community on those. And again it's just our recommendation of some things and I'm sure there'll be many more questions that come up along the way as as more folks introduce synthetics.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003635></a><a href=#003635>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h36m35s">00:36:35</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>What is the primary reasons for augmenting that checklist?

So our goal with this application and working with the larger Maker community, is to ultimately submit an application for treasuries using the TAP structure to be introduced as a type of collateral in the MCD system. Our position is that treasuries would be an essential or at least very, very important type of collateral to have within MCD. We think that in order for DAI to scale, it really requires users to be confident that DAI is backed by a sufficient amount of collateral, and you can really increase that confidence with DAI holders by backing DAI with a collateral that has a low likelihood of liquidation and we think that because DAI... Because treasuries are extremely stable, the likelihood of liquidation is very low. For example, in the 90... If you look at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of a one day movement of three month treasuries, it's less than 10 basis points. When you compare that to something like ETH, it's 16% so we think that treasuries are very, very stable, presents a very low liquidation risk and therefore maintains the integrity of DAI. However, as we've somewhat alluded to before, there may be scenarios, hopefully never, but we think there could at some point be a scenario where these assets, the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated and in such a scenario it is really important as we mentioned, for the underlying collateral to be liquidated. As I mentioned before, the depth of the market for treasuries is extremely large. The U.S. Treasury market is around $15 trillion worth of treasuries, and a substantial amount is traded every day, so we do not think that there would be any issues in liquidating treasuries in a scenario of a CDP liquidation, relative to potentially other synthetic types of collateral which may present some liquidity issues. And then finally we think that when we introduce treasuries as a type of collateral, the Maker community will actually gain a lot more control over the supply of DAI and therefore be able to increase the control of the peg of DAI to a dollar.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004042></a><a href=#004042>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h40m42s">00:40:42</a></td> <td>Mark Fernandes</td> <td>Now this really stems from the fact that treasuries are a fixed income product, meaning that they have a fixed rate of return.

There's a lot of speculation, there's a lot of volatility, and therefore it's tougher to make a judgment if it makes economic sense for you to open up or close your CDP. When you have a very stable asset, like treasuries introduced to this system which has a fixed rate of return, it makes that evaluation a lot more direct and a lot clearer. So the process of trying to maintain a peg of DAI to a dollar or some other peg is very, very... It's a lot more straight forward a process. So we think for these reasons, and there are probably some others where we think these are the most important, we think treasury should be introduced as a type of collateral.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004158></a><a href=#004158>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h41m58s">00:41:58</a></td> <td>LongForWisdom</td> <td>Can I interrupt with a question here?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004201></a><a href=#004201>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h42m01s">00:42:01</a></td> <td>Mark Fernandes</td> <td>Yep.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004203></a><a href=#004203>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h42m03s">00:42:03</a></td> <td>LongForWisdom</td> <td>So you make the point that the, because the treasuries have a fixed rate return, it's very easy to see when that return exceeds or is less than the stability rate, right?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004214></a><a href=#004214>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h42m14s">00:42:14</a></td> <td>Mark Fernandes</td> <td>Yes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004215></a><a href=#004215>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h42m15s">00:42:15</a></td> <td>LongForWisdom</td> <td>So would that not just lead to the entire collateral pool for treasuries, either disappearing or reappearing based on when it crosses that fixed threshold?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004226></a><a href=#004226>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLoqcivNvV0&t=00h42m26s">00:42:26</a></td> <td>Mark Fernandes</td> <td>Yeah, we think that there would be some users that have positions that are based on their loans of DAI that they can't immediately get out of, and so there won't be like an immediate action to close CDPs.

You can of course borrow something like USDC or lend it on something like Compound, but it doesn't offer you the option to obtain leverage on the same way that the Maker system does.
