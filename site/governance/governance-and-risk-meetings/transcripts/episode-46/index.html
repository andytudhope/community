Welcome to the August 1<sup>st</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. I was just checking the numbers and amazingly, this is our 45<sup>th</sup> scientific governance and risk meeting. That's 45 weeks of wall to wall analytical actions, so that's pretty impressive. It's quite a library of information to troll through. I think it's a bit of an achievement because keeping momentum up on these things is notoriously difficult and the fact that we've done it as a community is very heartening. It's good that we've maintained that momentum because that momentum is about to ramp up into overdrive there ... Thanks for the correction, David. This is about to ramp up into overdrive. We have a lot of things that are going to start happening in the next month or two. I keep on teasing that and it's generally my policy not to tease things because it's annoying.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000058></a><a href=#000058>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h00m58s">00:00:58</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>I was hoping to dig into some deep governance stuff today I got bumped because there's more interesting things happening that we can address immediately. We're going to have some a presentation from a new face in this call today, Primoz, who's just been working closely with our risk teams, is going to present some graphs to us, which I've been assured by Cyrus are dope, so dope. I'm looking forward to figuring out what that's all about. Let's talk about ... Well, let's do the preambles and then we'll talk about governance very quickly then we'll talk to, and we'll hear from David about what's been going on in the forums. The preamble is this. We are enormously interested in hearing what the community has to say and this is the opportunity for immediate back and forth.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000148></a><a href=#000148>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h01m48s">00:01:48</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>If you have a question, please type it into the chats. If you have access to a microphone, please pipe up and just ask your question. You can interrupt us. We don't mind. We also have a forum now. The forum is now my favorite place to be. I'm going to paste the link into the chat now. If you have a question that you feel didn't get addressed in the call or is outside of the scope of the call or just too much for the call to handle, please type it in this form thread. We're also going to be posting links to the videos after the call is over. We'll be posting summaries there. We'll be continuing the discussion. This is where the long tail governance happens. The forum is it. I think that you can refer back to the library of 46 previous episodes to figure out how important it is we consider the forum to be. I'm not going to get into that conversation today.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000244></a><a href=#000244>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h02m44s">00:02:44</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>What I am going to talk about is one of the first major items on our roadmap that's coming up on this march towards MCD launch is going to be the asset priority poll. We've talked about this in blogs. We haven't really talked about it in the call, we've talked about it in the chat, we've talked about it in the forums. The asset priority list is, our asset priority poll is a mechanism which will allow the community to surface, signal [inaudible 00:03:19] to let us know which priority, which assets they wants the community, the governance teams, the risk teams to focus on first. There's a lot of work to be done. There's seven assets that need to be evaluated with rigor. In order to get everybody on the same page, we to figure out which ones we're working on first.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000339></a><a href=#000339>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h03m39s">00:03:39</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>I've just posted a link to forum thread, cleverly entitled the asset priority poll. There's some discussions in there about different ways we can go about conducting this poll. What I'm doing here is I'd like to get some signals from the community. I want to know what the community thinks the best way of managing this poll is. There's some context about some of the limitations that we have in our existing system. We've never attempted to try to find a priority list and we don't have drag and droppable boxes and we don't have sliders and we don't have other pleasingly advanced UX mechanisms yet, but we can definitely shoehorn a priority poll into the system. Please have a look and then vote on the poll. Figure out which one you like. This is experiments and example of what I am going to continue to call an emergent process because that's what's happening where as a group figuring out how things should work.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000444></a><a href=#000444>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h04m44s">00:04:44</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>I like that way of doing things because there's two ways. Let's be binary about this. You can come up with a binder, spend six months working on that binder, drop it with a thud on a desk and then expect everybody to sort through that thing and look for edge cases or you can come up with some basic principles and basic assumptions of good ideas and then iterate over time. That's what's happening in the forums and it's like the crypto-y, open source-y. It's got us this far, so maybe it'll get us even further. What we're doing, the example of that emergent process is I referred heavily, when I was making this post, are two processes that was not created by the foundation. The processes were created by the community and this other thread called Meta governance and signal requests.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000533></a><a href=#000533>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h05m33s">00:05:33</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>We have a lot of people talking to each other, debating, what's the best way to surface a signal on the forums, and have that lead into a signal and a polling system. I actually referred to this new rules set in the forums to figure out how to do my job, which is a really cool way of moving this entire operation forward, I think. It's was super satisfying.

What happened was on the 19<sup>th</sup> of July, we saw a vote passed with 32,000 MKR. But since then, somebody lifted the hat of an old proposal and this old proposal happened to have around 78,000 MKR. Now, because this old proposal is the hat, in order for the current executive vote to pass, we need to have more than 78K MKR voting.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000903></a><a href=#000903>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h09m03s">00:09:03</a></td> <td>David Utrobin</td> <td>This presented some challenges to the community since it seems that MKR voters don't participate as much when it's not an emergency. Back when the peg was drifting below a dollar pretty consistently, everybody was on a high urgency mode, so we saw a lot more voter turnout in terms of raw amount of MKR that was being put up for these proposals. But since then, somebody ... If you don't withdraw your MKR from an old proposal, it's actually just going to sit there forever.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000936></a><a href=#000936>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h09m36s">00:09:36</a></td> <td>David Utrobin</td> <td>Although you can't cast the spell twice on a proposal, you can lift it to the hat, which just makes it a proposal that you have to beat. The thread covers this issue and I think actually the next version of DS chief solves this issue, but nevertheless, it's an interesting thread. Actually it's not necessarily bad because it might be that if we really do need to make a rate change, we're going to see the maker governance community actually rally, they have to rally at least 78K Maker to make any real change. It actually might increase voter engagement, but again, we have yet to see it.

Kwadrax is one of our awesome community members. He owns the MKR Gov Twitter handle and he had the idea to make this MKR Gov Twitter handle a bulletin board for MKR holders on Twitter who want to be informed.

I've been working together with Vishesh and Cyrus for some time developing risk model for MakerDAO. During this time, I was also focusing on various metrics that I wanted to present to you and I came across santiment, which was able to provide me with technical support for developing this platform, which I'm going to present to you now.

I'll go quickly through all the seven categories introduced. I won't cover all the graphs because there's so many of them, but then, yeah, here we go. The first category we called it network activity. It takes a look at onchain activitiy of DAI or Maker. We're going to focus on DAI now. You can also smooth the data for as many days as you want. Let's check first the address activity. This is the daily active addresses. The DAI addresses that interact daily with block chain and the number it's increasing and the trend is very positive. There's about 2000 active addresses constantly interacting, which is very positive. The orange line is the natural growth. These are the new addresses that generate the daily for DAI, which is also increasing, and very positive.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001448></a><a href=#001448>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h14m48s">00:14:48</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>This spike that you're seeing, this is the Coinbase effect. I'm going to call it Coinbase effect because you're going to see a bunch of times these kinds of effects from Coinbase that happened I think five days ago where they introduced the campaign. The blue line is active deposits on centralized changes and more or less it's flat because more or less everything is happening on chain with DAI, I guess. Every metric can be compared to with either the DAI price or Ether price. You can find some patterns here. I wasn't able to find anything actually, but I was able to find some patterns here, which the metric is called transaction volume, number of transactions basically on chain activity of DAI. What's perhaps is interesting is that every time the volume picks up for onchain activity for DAI and also the number of transactions, the DAI price tends to spike up.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001551></a><a href=#001551>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h15m51s">00:15:51</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>This happened also last year and this year. Most probably, this thing is connected with the fact that when there's increased activity or increased trading of DAI, people are mostly bidding up DAI, so mostly buying DAI. That's probably because when Ether prices falling, people want either to hedge and to go into DAI or what's even more possible is that CDPs they just want to protect their from getting liquidated and they start to repay their debts. That's why we always see a spike in volume and a spike in DAI price because there's obviously a bid. We also have mean and median transaction values. This metric went down from this year probably because there's much more users of DAI transacting. The mean is about few thousand, 5000, the median about 2000. You can see, again, this is the Coinbase effect when there was so many interactions, but really small amounts where we're actually traded to give ... not really traded, but transferred.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001703></a><a href=#001703>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h17m03s">00:17:03</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>The dailies of token circulation. Again, this is amount of DAI tokens that circulate every day, so the amount of tokens that actually are transferred. Again, it's picking up. This tells you about the adoption itself. It's connected to it spikes as well, like we saw before. What's interesting to me is that about three to four or maybe five million tokens circulate each day, which is, I don't know, about 5%. Velocity being about 5%, that's really high for a token. I think Ether has about 2% or something. DAI is trying to be medium of exchange token, that's pretty cool statistic that we see here. We have some top of transactions, but I'm not going to show you. There's nothing really relevant. The next category of CDP stats. Basically, we want it to show the activity of CDPs from locks, frees, wipes and so on, you can compare it with Ether price and what you can also do is you recalculate all the event types to DAI.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001815></a><a href=#001815>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h18m15s">00:18:15</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>I prefer to use DAI because if you're looking at what's happening with locks and frees, which are denominated in Ether, it's much better to look through it, I mean, to show the dollar well, that's why I chose DAI. I won't spend much time here, but again, you can see the Coinbase effect, a lot of ether, I mean, the amount of locks was pretty high, but if you look at the value itself, nothing relevant. Right. These CDPs were just opened, not much collateral was posted or DAI drawn. Of course, locks are above frees because system was growning much more collateral was provided than freed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001902></a><a href=#001902>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h19m02s">00:19:02</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>Similarly, nominal terms in values. We could see some frees recently, which is connected with larger CDPs free in collateral which we're going to show later why they were doing this or which were doing this. Probably connect it with refinancing with secondary platforms. Similar story with draws and wipes, Coinbase effect here. A lot of DAI. A lot of events of DAI being drawn, but in the nominal terms, basically zero. Again, similar story, some wipes recently, but mostly we were seeing draws. I won't go into details here. Open CDPs. Again, Coinbase effect. What's interesting is that daily they're about 40 CDPs opened and it's pretty constant. They're trying to syncr..., I mean, the amount of CDPs is increasing. This is one outlier here.

Then we have CDP distribution. The amount of Ether locked in a CDP, mean and median. You could see the mean was going down since New Year. That's probably because there are more CDPs introduced with smaller amounts of Ether locked so more Ether using CDPs and probably also because larger CDPs, the whales were removing a lot of collateral, especially in the last few months, so that's why this was dropping. That's why the overall collateral was dropping.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002047></a><a href=#002047>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h20m47s">00:20:47</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>We also can have CDP distribution by locked Ether value based on different type of CDP groups.

These were the guys who were actually freeing Ether. Of course, they were doing this because Ether price went up and they just kept too much collateral, also because they wanted to monetize on the profits because they wanted to repay some debt. It's interesting because if you look at a smaller CPDs, they weren't really freeing much Ether. It's more or less constant. The whales were the ones actually causing this collateral to drop in the last few months. We have pooled Ether to wrapped Ether ratio.

We could see there was actually a record happening five days ago. This was connected with one CDP I'm going to show you later, which wiped $10 million of debt in 10 days and it removed 100,000 collateral. This was one of the biggest CDPs. What's interesting is that he actually, in one chart, he paid so much Maker. What's also interesting is that he was paying the fee with the DAI actually. This event might be causing Maker price going up. I'm not sure what happened on that day. We have bites as well. This is connected with liquidations. You could see recent bites. This the volume of them. It wasn't as high as in last year, but if you look at the amount of bites, it was quite high, right. I would say that most of the liquidations that happened recently at the last Ether price drop was affecting smaller CDPs, whereas in the history, last year, bigger CDPs were liquidated. I was checking the collateralization ratios of bigger CDPs is now much higher than it was last year.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002323></a><a href=#002323>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h23m23s">00:23:23</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>It seems that like they learned their lesson or something. They are much more cautious than they were last year when smaller CDPs mostly got liquidated. This is a graph of liquidations at what price of Ether liquidations for the quarter, how much debt would be brought back and number of CDPs. I think there's a bug here. I'm pretty sure. We need to fix this. We also have liquidation distribution again classified by how big these CDPs are. Obviously, the purple line, the biggest CDPs. The curve is the steepest because it's every increment prize drop of Ether that would be most of the liquidations happening from their side.

Basically, what I wanted to show was the mean liquidation price. If you don't consider the distribution, just how much would the Ether price needs to drop to have total portfolio liquidated. You could just say, "Okay, there's the DAI supply and we want 150 liquidation ratio, how much would the Ether price need to drop to get liquidated?" It's not really relevant but it's good to see distance among them or between them, but the distance cannot be shown now because they're in two different scale axis now.

He removed in two days. Actually no, it was in 10 days, so there are some other larger CDPs doing the same. He removed 100,000 of Ether. It's so interesting to see that he actually traded the Ether to repay the debt. I guess this was happening from 5<sup>th</sup> in July till now and probably he was causing the price back to go up because he was buying DAI to repay the debt.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002624></a><a href=#002624>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h26m24s">00:26:24</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>After he was able to pay the debt, he transferred to Ether. I think one part, we are used to that as well to Compound. All the increase, I mean not all the increase, but a lot of increase at secondary lenders such as Compound that we saw in last month or last 15, 20, days a lot was caused by this CDP. We looked it on chain, it's so interesting to see if he can transfer Ether there and then he just issued additional DAI. He basically refinanced the DAI from Maker at Compound, but he didn't issue only DAI. He also issued USDC probably because the rates are much smaller. Of course, he issued DAI there because the rates are smaller as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002711></a><a href=#002711>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h27m11s">00:27:11</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>I haven't checked if he then later sold that DAI.

In USD similar story, but this includes Ether price and then the collateralization ratio which we are focusing a lot on, we know it's peaked and now it went down because Ether price went down. Also, because there are a lot of Ether removed from collateral, but what's perhaps one of the most interesting charts is this one and they call it nominal collateralization ratio.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002819></a><a href=#002819>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h28m19s">00:28:19</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>It basically checks the amount of Ether, but not in dollar terms, just the amount of Ether versus DAI supply. The good thing about this graph is that it isolates from Ether price, so it captures the user behavior. That's something that I wanted to see because user behavior we all know is one of the most important part at making risk assessment of total portfolio because they could protect from getting liquidated, right. You could see the inverse relation. When either price was dropping, CDPs were either posting traditional collateral to portfolio or they were repaying the debt. Once the Ether price started rising, they either issued more debt because there were more bullish and partially they also freed up some collateral because it was worth more in dollar terms, right.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002914></a><a href=#002914>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h29m14s">00:29:14</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>This graph is quite cool, and you can see the spike here, right. The last few weeks when Ether price drops, immediately they posted additional collateral and they protected it from getting liquidated. Something that we'll probably going to use for when we're going model the user behavior, which is one of the most important aspects of making risk assessments. We have collateralization ratio again based on different CDP sizes. Again, it's interesting to see how whales or the biggest CDPs are most collateralized. You can see here 500%, 600% and more, right. These are the biggest ones.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003000></a><a href=#003000>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h30m00s">00:30:00</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>Of course, when they reached the high number, they freed up some collateral.

This is one graph that should be working here. Again, this is the nominal collateralization ratio that I presented before. I wanted to see the pattern. Again, this number itself doesn't tell anything. It just the pattern that you're interested to see how they behave. You could see that they all behave similarly except again for the bigger CDPs who were a bit more cautious here and who have higher nominal collateralization ratio than the smaller ones.

Like saying, re-pledging the DAI, the debt or let's say putting collateral on leverage on top of other collateral that CDPs pull from their own sources. This blue line is actually tells you the number of Ether that was brought to collateral in addition to all collateral, that was brought in by them. Or, if I correct myself now, the amount of Ether that came to collateral by trading DAI, so by leverage. We know that part of collateral in MakerDAO is purely on debt, right?

But then we also have total holders balance. This one is really interesting because it basically shows you within the category how much DAI those addresses hold. It was interesting when I saw this.

Another very interesting thing we've been working on is holders breakdown. Now, our job would be to detect all the DAI holders and classify them who they are. Of course, that's impossible, but we were quite successful. We were able to identify, I think this is one-third of addresses and we classify them into seven categories.

The spread was evenly distributed around the dollars, slightly skewed down. Then what's interesting is actually if you look at the last seven days, it has pretty much been hovering just above and below the dollar. Over the last seven days, it's netted out to actually slightly above a dollar, even though in the last 24 hours it's slightly below. I would say pretty darn balanced right now. Supply had come down to about 77, 78 million last we checked on it. It's pretty much sat there.

I tweeted out this graph here, some of you may have seen it, but essentially was just stratifying the DAI supply by collateralization ratio buckets. All of the CDPs, all the DAI that lives in them counted up and stratified into different effectively bands of risks and then graph that visually here is a stack graph to add back up to the DAI supply. Then you can also see here smoothed out a little bit over a seven day mean average. It's really interesting to see, and this goes in tandem with what Primoz was showing, as that DAI supply grows, even though collateralization ratio shot up from 300% to almost 500%, and then back down to around 450% and has now come down a little bit lower, it doesn't tell the whole story because it's really not the greatest measure of risk.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004656></a><a href=#004656>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h46m56s">00:46:56</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Because risk actually more is weighted more heavily on the lower collateralization ratios and much less on the higher collateralization ratios. Above 500% collateralization, there's very little to no risk, right. It would take a tremendous drop in ETH price to create a negative outcomes for Maker holders. Then what we really want to be visualizing is how much of the debt is really living in this red zone? That's roughly what this strives to do is to say, how much of the debt is below, say 200% collateralization or 300% collateralization? That is a much better tracking of the aggregate amount of risk in the system because as Primoz had shown, there's a bunch of large CDPs that are very heavily collateralized and so those actually carry much less risk with them.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004751></a><a href=#004751>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h47m51s">00:47:51</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>It's really interesting to see is actually in tandem with what Primoz was showing again, where his graphs shows spikes in "leveraging behavior" around September and December, that actually corresponds very well with the amount of debt that lives below, say 300% collateralization. Those values were at their highest around September and December and have come down fairly significantly since then. You can see just this huge growth funny enough aligned with the explosion of secondary lending platforms, a growth in the percentage of CPDs or rather the percentage of debt that lives at an extremely high collateralization ratio. It's possible and this would take a lot more investigation that those secondary lending platforms actually disproportionately took on riskier loans for Maker, right.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004847></a><a href=#004847>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h48m47s">00:48:47</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>We know, we've seen and shown that there was a lot of refinancing behavior, but it would be really interesting then to understand if it was disproportionate refinancing where some of the more risk-seeking CDP owners were the ones that refinance to secondary lending platforms, which would make sense with lower collateral requirements, liquidation penalties, ratios, things like that. It does make sense that Maker has some of the more conservative risk parameters out there right now so it would actually attract some of the less risky lenders and borrowers. That's a really interesting thing to double click on. Just to touch on one other point here, I'm sorry there's a little two day break in the graph there.

You could see the unpaid fees were increasing at a much higher rate before, but with this rapid increase and a leveling off of unpaid fees due to a significant decrease in supply, and as I had shown previously with the circulation graphs, a lot of that supply was with older debt before.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005045></a><a href=#005045>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=00h50m45s">00:50:45</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Those older CDPs had a much higher proportion of the unpaid fees because they've been accrued for quite a while. Somebody had recently shared in the Maker chat their breakdown of unpaid fees versus potential liquidation penalties and they'd shown that the unpaid fees don't in any cases come close to exceeding the liquidation penalties, so that's not a realistic concern at the moment.

For the secondary lending, there was this run up in the rates and the utilization on the secondary lending platforms just at the end of July there. That has come down a little bit, so that's pretty interesting. The DAI supply overall has come down and the 20.5% stability fee has held. There wasn't a change there that could have caused an increase in supply and potentially an increase in supply in secondary lending platforms, but what's interesting is it was not moved. This is just stabilization from what's been going on with ETH price and I think some degree of delayed effects, which was something that I was stressing last week is given some time, some of these metrics do tend to like go out, which is I think basically what we've been seeing happening because the DAI price, which was sitting above had come below and then gone back above.

So, do you think that now since that amount of DAI, excess DAI is increasing and the borrow rate is decreasing, it's going to cause this positive feedback loop of even more people refinancing their debt from Maker, DAO to Compound and thus further decreasing the total DAI supply.

So, for example, if you think about, if supply is actually contracting and at the end of the day the amount of DAI that lives on Maker has not significantly changed, and the amount of DAI being borrowed on secondary lending platforms is not significantly changed, then you have to think about what did change. And I think this goes back to some of the leverage graphs that we were showing. So the CDP distribution graphs that I had shown or some of Primoz's graphs on DAI for ETH trades.

And so they incur a lot of slippage, or they end up depleting the order book all of a sudden and they experience either particularly high or particularly low prices. That tends to happen with DAI because I think the liquidity on these order books is low, is relatively thin and so in short timeframes, it does experience a fair amount of impermanent market impact from either selling or buying behavior.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010902></a><a href=#010902>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=01h09m02s">01:09:02</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So, my point is I think the most reasonable expectation, if none of those other stats have significantly changed in the past week is that there was some de-leveraging, someone gave up on their ETH long position and so sold some DAI and either got a really good rate for it or took a haircut because they were the ones who had the high time preference and they were just trying to sell quickly.

I don't think it's like a big macro trend or anything is my point. And I think this fluctuation, this actually does touch on your question. This fluctuation will continue to happen where the utilization on these secondary learning platforms will go up, the rates will go up. Then somewhere, somehow some more DAI will be sourced. Some over supply will find its way onto secondary lending platforms. Rates will go down a little bit and then you'll oscillate through this I think to the extent that some oversupply exists.

One of the things that I'd be looking at is and I've shown this a couple of weeks ago, was transaction volume of DAI. So transactional volume of DAI picked up rather significantly especially compared to trading volume of DAI, which has been low to middling range for it's longterm average. To me this is primarily as a result of a lot more usage in smart contracts and a lot more DAI being passed back and forth through the DeFi ecosystem. But one of the metrics that I've tracked over time is the amount of DAI that's being held by CDP owners.

So maybe you can pretty much answer a little bit about how you think about tracking, how that DAI moves hands if it moves like multiple addresses, right. So people may have multiple contracts or multiple addresses that [inaudible 01:13:09] chain ownership of those CDPs and subsequently where that DAI changes hands.

Because some CDPs are pretty sophisticated and they do transaction actually in, you could say in the same cash, they just issue it and they just send it to exchange and it's done. So we don't see it on the address or it's like immediately happening. But some, they trade it really slowly, so they always have some amount. They don't issue one million of DAI and then they have this DAI on their address and then they sell it. But what they do, issue I don't know, 50,000 of DAI because that's the only thing they could sell at the moment because the markets are still not that liquid and they don't want the slippage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011440></a><a href=#011440>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=01h14m40s">01:14:40</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>And then they do this in small increments.

So if there's an average user coming onto an analytics site I think they'd want to see some of the more important CDP statistics, stability fees across the various collateral types, DSR when it comes. And then for example just speaking at a glance, I think some metric of distribution of DAI is useful. So there's 90 million and 10 million of it is in Compound or whatnot.

Please continue the discussion in the forums, how to look at the signal request for what the asset party list might look like and have a poke around because there's a lot of interesting chats going on in there and a lot of decisions that need to be made and touching on Matthew's point, we have a series of polls that we have identified in the last couple of months. And in the next couple of weeks, we're going to be able to act on those. So let's put some effort into resurrecting those threads and maybe refining them for implementation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012347></a><a href=#012347>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUvfcEgt0o4&t=01h23m47s">01:23:47</a></td> <td>Rich Brown</td> <td>Thanks everybody.
