everyone, welcome to the July 25<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting with MakerDAO, my name is Richard Brown, I'm the head of community development at MakerDAO. In these calls we talk about risk, we talk about risk parameters as well. We talk about new collateral types that might be coming in and out of the system. We talk about governance issues.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000025></a><a href=#000025>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h00m25s">00:00:25</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Over a time the weight of which issues we focus on is shifts back and forth depending on what's cooking at MakerDAO and what's cooking in the community. That's my way of pointing out that we're not always going to be talking about risk, the way that we have in the past. And in the next couple weeks we're going to be shifting gears slightly to everybody's favorite topic, which is governance.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000049></a><a href=#000049>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h00m49s">00:00:49</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>There's lots of things we need to figure out in the governance world. Going to come as no surprise to this group that governance is not a solved problem. MakerDAO, again, is sort of on the leading edge of a lot of issues in the crypto space, one of them is how do we organize lots of people around the world? And how do we organize them when the stakes are high? I guess is an interesting way of putting it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000115></a><a href=#000115>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h01m15s">00:01:15</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>What we do here is kind of important and so we need to take governance seriously. What those mechanisms look like, what the processes look like, what the debates look like. How signals get surfaced, how they get ratified. These are all important questions that we need to figure out. And we're going to start doing that in earnest.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000133></a><a href=#000133>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h01m33s">00:01:33</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The reason why we're going to start doing that in earnest is because multi collateral DAI is a real thing and it's coming. I touched on this briefly in our last call, but when multi collateral DAI launches is depending on two different factors. Basically you can put it into two different buckets. One is the mechanics, the code, the audits, our partners, all these things need to align. So it's what pieces of puzzle we can put in place in the foundation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000207></a><a href=#000207>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h02m07s">00:02:07</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>But there's the other bucket, the other side of this coin, whatever analogy you want to mix together there, and that's governance and the community. When MCD launches is largely dependent on what happens in the forums, what happens in these calls, what happens in various discussions, and what ultimately happens in the voting portal. There's a lot of work that we all need to do together in order to make that happen. Lots of risk analysts, lots of governance fans, if that's even a thing. I guess it is a thing, we can find them all over our forums.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000240></a><a href=#000240>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h02m40s">00:02:40</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We need to align and we need to get to work, and we need to establish processes and policies and principles, and we need to optimize this process as much as we possibly can in such a way that we maintain agility but we also gain some more velocity. And that's a lot of buzz words, and it's a lot of theoretical analogies, but these things are all going to start kicking off in the next week's call, and the week after that we're going to wrap things up. And the week after that we're going to continue to do it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000316></a><a href=#000316>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h03m16s">00:03:16</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>There'll be some proposals and some clarification of some of the things that I'm talking about that'll show up in the forum soon. And we can start a large conversation, a long tailed conversation about how that impacts the organization, how that impacts governance and how everybody feels about it. There is a lot of things coming up, but that a lot of things coming speech that I just gave is sort of my way of compensating for the fact that I have very little to talk about today.

And also because if you have 8% that's actually I think two, four, six, eight, yeah it's still nine options, so if you remove the 8% you actually have less options on the poll overall than we currently have.

People were levering up during that time, it held steady at the turn of the month, and people had not cashed out during that time.

So if you were to look at a second derivative of the ETH price compared to its long run average, effectively what you're saying is, when was it decreasing? When was it increasing?

So a lot of traders who levered up on ETH using DAI, and now have to either re-liquidate it, or have to make a hard decision of holding onto that position and paying increasingly higher interest rates, not just on Maker, but now with the change in how Compound is calculating their interest rates, or the removal of the Cap effectively.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003549></a><a href=#003549>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h35m49s">00:35:49</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Those interest rates have gone up as well, because the excess supply has dwindled to next to nothing on secondary lending platforms.

So if I run this back through an analysis script it wouldn't produce hugely different values, but when you plug in that ... and this is what Licks is alluding to is noise in the prices vs. order books. But the noise in the prices is actually also an important data point to capture, right? Because those prices that those trades are getting executed at is effectively what people had to do during that time period because more often than not I think when people are trading DAI they have a very high time preference for getting access to that DAI, or selling that DAI to get access to leverage to take advantage of a particular price.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003846></a><a href=#003846>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=00h38m46s">00:38:46</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And so DAI I think is actually a very high time preference currency very often.

Drops of the stability fee, and at the same time ETH price running up. And then DAI supply is running up with significant amount of leveraging behavior, but at a higher stability fee.

And so if there was ... right, so this is what I was talking about is the volume is mid to low range in the 3-4 million range. Had it been 14 million yesterday, then you would have seen a huge run up in DAI price.

And this is I think the really hard thing for people to get away from is just looking at the DAI price as being the be all and end all. When that excess supply has soaked up fairly significantly, I think now as long as DAI price is in a relatively good place, right?

I hear myself talk, I hear people on these governance calls talk. I hear a lot of great posts on the forums and the chats, but rarely do they tend to be making the same case as what the polls and the votes end up being.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012144></a><a href=#012144>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h21m44s">01:21:44</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And so what I'm really missing from my perspective as like a participant of this community is understanding really well why 18.5%, what were people thinking?

So it's like this is how you going to go about doing this. What I'm more talking about is, it may not necessarily be writing it out because I think that's high overhead and you're not likely to force people to write out what they're thinking. But there has to be a way at some point I think to understanding why people are voting the way they are. It doesn't necessarily have to be writing it out.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012231></a><a href=#012231>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h22m31s">01:22:31</a></td> <td>Psybull</td> <td>So my thinking on this was just that, a lot of it mirrors what Vishesh was just talking about. I think I guess what I'm thinking is like I would like to post it to the forum because I do feel like there's no current coordinated place to talk about what you're voting or why you voted. And so I guess I'm looking in one sense I'm looking like should be do the discussion afterwards? Which is like, I don't say anything before, but afterwards I say, hey I voted 19.5, here's my reasons, blah blah blah.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012305></a><a href=#012305>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h23m05s">01:23:05</a></td> <td>Psybull</td> <td>Or is it valuable to do it ... or do people think there's value to doing it during the process where I can say, okay once I've made up my mind I think there is definitely a piece of it speaks to what David is bringing up. With like it helps me crystallize my reasoning. But I do think that for instance part of the reason that I think this is important is that I'm pretty sure there is some 14,000 Maker holder that is constantly voting on the rates, but is not reading ... either not reading chat regularly, or not reading chat at all.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012335></a><a href=#012335>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h23m35s">01:23:35</a></td> <td>Psybull</td> <td>And so I don't know the way to kind of funnel everyone into one place to talk about it, but I feel like the forum post for the current executive poll or regular poll is not a bad place to do it. So I'm just going to start doing it there and we'll see. If other people want to do something different, but like the chat is definitely the wrong place and it's too ephemeral. But yeah, I do think we need somewhere where we can start, just to kind of funnel everyone into a discussion about it because I do think there is a huge disconnect between how the people are voting and how the talk about it in governance process goes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012410></a><a href=#012410>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb3xB_WCfQ&t=01h24m10s">01:24:10</a></td> <td>David Utrobin</td> <td>Yeah, I think when Rich posts those threads every time there's a vote that's what the threads are meant to be, but they just [inaudible 01:24:17].
