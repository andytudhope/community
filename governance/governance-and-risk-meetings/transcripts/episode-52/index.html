Brown</td> <td>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the September 12<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting. My name is Richard Brown. I am the head of Community Development at MakerDAO. Today we are going to talk about governance. We are going to talk about risk, and we are going to continue what I believe is going to be a new trend, talking about Oracles. As the governance ecosystem becomes more and more complicated, or sophisticated maybe I should say, we are going to be bringing new actors into the system that are empowered by the community to do things on behalf of the community. Hopefully in some near term but glorious future, we will begin to engage with community members who are acting on behalf of the community as well post MCD.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000047></a><a href=#000047>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h00m47s">00:00:47</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>But, in order to get there, we have a lot of work to do, and that's the work we're doing in these calls. So, today we have governance. We have oracles, and then we have risk. And, the governance... I'm sorry. I forgot my preambles again. I am going to continue to beg and grovel. If people have questions, please feel free to ask those questions at any moment, so type them in the chat if you don't have access to a microphone. If you do have access to a microphone, please interrupt us. We love it when that happens. And, just ask away. We will deal with questions as they arise.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000122></a><a href=#000122>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h01m22s">00:01:22</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>If you want to formulate your questions and ask later, at the top of the hour... at the end of the hour, sorry, we'll have just a general Q &amp; A session, so we'll stick around for 30 minutes and talk about anything that people might have on their minds. I think that's... That's enough for the preambles today. I'm going to try and keep this as tight as I possibly can.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000142></a><a href=#000142>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h01m42s">00:01:42</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So, in the governance world, we have a couple of interesting things happened, good news and more good news. The good news being that the community shows overwhelmingly not to fire Cyrus and Rich from the governance ecosystem. That was nice to hear, so we still have public jobs. The governance facilitator role was ratified with a 99.9% approval rating. I'm still daily appreciating whoever it was that bought $20 in MKR to vote no against me. I love you. I want to send you a T-shirt if you're willing to send me your address.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000220></a><a href=#000220>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h02m20s">00:02:20</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Cyrus, on the other hand, was 100% approval, because I guess he's like .5% more approachable than I am, I suppose. The good news there, though, is that we can begin to start doing some work in earnest. I believe it was Cyrus that voted no. I actually planned to buy $21 in MKR and vote no against Cyrus just to make my stats look better, but I forgot.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000246></a><a href=#000246>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h02m46s">00:02:46</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So, yeah, we have a lot of work to do, and so we are going to start doing that work. And, part of that work is evidenced by the activity in the forums recently. I know that LongFor... I'm not going to steal his thunder. LongForWisdom can tell us a bit about some of that, but we've had these slow burn issues for awhile now around cadence of the votes of the stability fees, questions around do we really need to be doing this every single week?

So, I need to walk this fine line. The community keeps on lowering the stability fee, which is good. That's a very good thing, because it shows the ecosystem that the MKR holders, the voters, are not self-interested to the point of self-destruction. They're not going to raise the stability fee endlessly in some hopes of burning all the MKR in existence. They will actually lower the stability fee when it's appropriate. This shows that the community and the MKR holders hold the stability of DAI paramount over everything else, and that's precisely what this ecosystem... or what this governance ecosystem is designed ultimately to do.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000449></a><a href=#000449>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h04m49s">00:04:49</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We need to support the peg, so we can support the protocol, so the protocol can support DeFi, and DeFi can take over the world.

So, that led to a sort of early exit if everyone is kind of fine with something, like if someone's just picking out some personal bugaboo with the system, then everyone can sort of say it's fine and it can end early.

We can either come up with a 600 page manual about how governance is going to work and attempt to predict how the future will shake out. I think that might be fraught with peril.

And, thank you, again. So, one of the things... I don't want to go on for too long, but one of the things I wanted to touch on, I got a few questions last week from people about why are we doing this and why now? The Oracles were always meant to be handed over to governance, and it's part of this drive of gradual decentralization that the foundation has committed to that we're starting to do this now. And, in particular, the proposal that I think was the most confusing to people was the one talking about the incentives, and why do we need them? Why are we doing this?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002429></a><a href=#002429>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h24m29s">00:24:29</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So, I wanted to share my screen real quick and show you guys the same diagram I showed you last week, but to expand on it a little bit more. Okay. So, this diagram is showing the different actors in the Oracle ecosystem. So, on the bottom left here we have you guys who are the MKR token holders. On the top here, we have the feeds, and I think this maybe wasn't as clear last week about what a feed is. But, feeds are kind of humans or organizations that are running a bot, and all this bot does is it sources the prices for an asset and then it signs with your identity saying I think... you know, Feed A thinks the price of bitcoin is this. And, essentially feeds are the inputs for the Oracle smart contracts, where people will actually get the canonical Oracle price from.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002551></a><a href=#002551>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h25m51s">00:25:51</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So, if you're on this diagram, you can see the feeds are pushing the prices to the Oracle smart contracts. And, down on the bottom here you have kind of data consumers, so you can think of them as Dapps or other smart contracts. And, other smart contracts can then read the prices from the Oracle smart contracts, and they're meant to then enumerate MKR holders in some way.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002621></a><a href=#002621>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h26m21s">00:26:21</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>And, so why did we set it up this way? We didn't used to regulate access on the Oracle prices to external partners. You know, why are we starting to do this now, I think, is the biggest question that we got. So, there's a couple reasons, but the main two that I would like to focus on is decentralization and sustainability.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002651></a><a href=#002651>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h26m51s">00:26:51</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>Currently, the dev fund is paying feeds for the price service that they're providing. It is the intention that eventually MKR holders will take over that responsibility through the use of stability fees, because the Maker foundation may not be around forever, may not have buckets of money forever, and so if you want to make a resilient Oracle system, you need to decentralize the funding of it as well. And, the stability fee mechanism provides a nice way to do that.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002732></a><a href=#002732>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h27m32s">00:27:32</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>But, if MKR holders are going to be spending their money on feeds, they're going to probably want some way to then monetize that feed infrastructure, right? If they're paying the feeds and they're administrating this entire Oracle ecosystem, it only makes sense that they have the ability to monetize it as well. And, so that's why we've added this white list to the Oracle smart contracts, and essentially, the white list is a list of smart contract addresses that governance controls. So, you guys get to decide who is allowed to read prices from the Oracles and who is not, and in doing so, you can charge a fee for that. Right? So, you can go to token company X, right, and they want to read the BTC price, and you guys can say, okay, good, well that's going to cost you 5,000 DAI annually or something like that.

So, what this proposal does is it's not actually enforcing this particular combination of relationships between all the actors, right? So, I said earlier that the Maker development fund is paying the fees right now, so really this piece does not... this is not applicable to this proposal. Right? I've also said last week that for business development purposes, and really for just being a good actor in the ecosystem. We shouldn't be charging anything to be on the white list for the first year. We have a lot, and I mean a lot of projects using our Oracles.

So, let's say there's a DEX, and this DEX wants to start offering margin trading. Well, if you want to offer margin trading, you're going to need Oracles, right, to know when to liquidate the positions, when to margin call.

It's not really a decision but rather an educational topic, is where the DSR even comes from and how it's created, and so forth. So, essentially, the DSR is... when you put DAI into the DSR contract and then you retrieve it, obviously, you are taking out more DAI than you put in. So, natural question, where does additional DAI come from? The DSR contract has the functionality to essentially just print that DAI and give it to you regardless of any exogenous factors or just collateral or what not.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003550></a><a href=#003550>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h35m50s">00:35:50</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>And, at first glance, this seems concerning, right, because kind of the main tagline has always been collateral backed DAI and this appears to be an instance where DAI is being minted without any collateral being posted against it. But, to kind of remedy this little issue, the amount of DSR that is created gets weighted... not weighted, but gets counted against the collected stability fees or the internal surplus of the system such that if, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough collected stability fees to pay out the DSR, then the DSR essentially gets recorded as bad debt.

And, so the question is to what extend do we allow for... I don't know if subsidy is the correct word here, but, essentially, do we allow for leeway for certain collateral types, and then either MKR pay for it out of the total stability fees collected or, potentially, there are options of collateral specific DSR adjustments.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003859></a><a href=#003859>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h38m59s">00:38:59</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>So, for example, if there's a particular collateral type that is extremely popular, is generating a lot of DAI, and is, for whatever reason, contributing to... is proportionally contributing more to a DAI price decline, then would it make sense to add extra stability fee to the collateral type loan separate from its already calculated risk premium rate?

So, basically, as that collateralization ratio fell, one of the more common activities, rather than adding back collateral, was actually to remove some debt, clear it out, refinance it, whatever.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004836></a><a href=#004836>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h48m36s">00:48:36</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And, so that's, I think, part of the reason why you saw some of this drop in debt, and that's pretty well explicable by a bit of decreased demand for leverage, given the way ETH prices have been.

And, given that the actual total Maker supply has been pretty steady, decreased a little bit, recovered a little bit, but more or less overall pretty steady, this could be interpreted as a bit of a drop in demand. And, so I don't want to FUD, but I would just say keep an eye on this with regards to how much we're dropping that stability fee, because though the DAI price is doing well right now, if there is a sudden bull market, that would be a pretty fluid situation and you could see these rates and the prices for DAI respond pretty quickly.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005552></a><a href=#005552>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=00h55m52s">00:55:52</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Though, it will be interesting to sort of... that would be kind of a third cycle for DAI, so it would be interesting to see what happens in that situation and how resilient it actually is now, because what we did observe was the second time we went through that situation, DAI was a bit more resilient than it was the first time.

I've learned a lesson that if we put up with at least 35 seconds of uncomfortable silence, some of you will continue to answer questions, so we'll use that as a plan in the future, and I won't end these calls so quickly. All right. Thanks, everybody. Talk to you next week. Look for forum thread, look for YouTube, look for SoundClouds, and follow me on Twitter. Like, subscribe, and whatever else. All right.
