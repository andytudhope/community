<td align=left>Hello everyone and welcome to the Thursday March the 21<sup>st</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting at MakerDAO. Today's meeting is going to be following a common theme that we're discussed in our last call. Steven were you gonna get into that, should I talk about themes or did you wanna pick that up?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0026>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=00m26s">00:26</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>I'll just pick that up if you don't mind.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0028>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=00m28s">00:28</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I would not mind at all. So I'll do the preamble then, hooray. For people that haven't heard this 27 times already, if you're a long time listener, we're very interested in facilitating a conversation, that is the point of these calls. We need information from the community, we have a lot of very, very smart people on this call, [inaudible 00:00:47] space we need to know what they're thinking. So, if you have a question, if you have a comment, an observation, please type that into the chat at the side. And if you don't have a microphone somebody will find that and we'll do our best to read these questions out. If we don't get an opportunity to read those questions out, what we've been doing is copying the unanswered questions and then adding them to the post meeting discussion thread in Reddit. And hopefully we'll be able to pick those things up during the course of the week, before our next call.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0118>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=01m18s">01:18</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>But that post discussion thread in Reddit is a new addition to the proceedings, and what we've been doing is ... The conclusion is that there is far too much going on these calls, but this isn't really the place to make firm decisions or achieve consensus, this is the place to observe data, have a discussion, set the context and tone of what we're up to. And then we will aggregate that data with the recordings and the transcripts and all the rest into Reddit, and then we'll continue with that debate in a text form and hopefully a civilized and restrained manner for the next week or so, and that will lead us to a long term decision making process. But it also creates a historical record, so we can exactly what was talked about and when, and all the rest. So those are for the typed in questions, if you have access to a microphone, feel free to jump in at any time if you have a question, comment or a complaint, and we will address it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0218>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=02m18s">02:18</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So back to the theme of typing out the agenda, I'm gonna hand it off to Steven immediately and then Steven's gonna talk to us about some interesting things in his world and governance in general. Then I'm going to pick it up and I'll have a brief chat about the state of governance that got us up to this point, so what happened in the votes last week with the poll, how that positions us today and what the next steps are. And after that we'll talk to ... Cyrus will tell us about the numbers, so Cyrus from risk will give us a presentation. After that, we'll jump into a Q&amp;A. All right, off to you Steven.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0256>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=02m56s">02:56</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Thank you very much. Firstly, good morning, good afternoon, good evening everyone. Thank you for joining us. The one thing I'd like to do is to extend the point that Rich was making. I would like to basically take this opportunity to consider and remind ourselves the two important points. The first is the structure of these calls, and the second is the reason for these calls. It is extraordinarily important we need to consider this because ... Excuse me a sec. It really boils down to participation and the sense of what the participation looks like. So to the structure of these calls. The structure of these calls will be based around one or a collection of the following themes. The first theme is effectively the state of demand and supply in the system. The second theme is with respect to collateral types, collateral portfolio and the related risk parameters attributed to them, and the portfolio as a whole. And then the third theme is with respect to exogenous risk, a risk that is outside of the system that we still need to consider. For example, risk exposed by the Ethereum protocol as an example.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0410>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=04m10s">04:10</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>These themes are, I would say broad enough to capture the full ambit of what we need to consider in these calls. So for today's calls we'll unsurprisingly focus on the state of demand and supply. But please keep in mind that the main theme of the call can change and is dependent on what MKR governance would like to tackle. So the folks facilitating this call are here to kick the process off and get the conversation and momentum going around governance, but at the same time be very mindful of what MKR holders look to, to talk about and want to get in to. So that being said, I'd also like to remind everyone as to the purpose of this call. This call is a place that helps facilitate and only facilitate a part of the whole governance process. And this process, this whole governance process is the sole responsibility of MKR token holders, collectively known as governance. And it is really up to this to decentralized governance to decide the direction of the system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0520>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=05m20s">05:20</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Please keep this in mind because it is really important to understand that the [inaudible: "owner"?] responsibility is on you as a stakeholder in the system, and it is very much on you as MKR token holder. And we are here to help facilitate this process and to basically try and keep it contiguous and flowing and with a certain amount of momentum that the salient features and the important points are always in the minds eye of MKR token holders, or what obviously we'd like to collectively know as the decentralized governance of the system. So that's my little intro for today, as I said the theme for today will be again on demand and supply. That's where we kick off, but obviously as Q&amp;As come in, we can figure out how we can tackle other challenges as well. So given that, I'm gonna pass back to Rich.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0616>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=06m16s">06:16</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>All right, thanks Steven, it's good to set that context. Actually, I'm a huge fan of context myself, so I'm gonna do some of my own. Let's talk about how voting has worked in the system over the last seven days. We've seen some interesting things. After the call last Thursday, we brought the discussion into Reddit. We just had a very spirited chat, it was great, the level of discourse in our sub Reddit is constantly a source of amazement to me. I'm not sure if everybody here are active Redditors or not, but frankly Reddit is a sass pool, especially when it comes to Crypto. But MakerDAO's sub-reddits are shining exceptions to that rule, which I'm not sure, entirely sure how that happened or why, but I'm gonna do everything I can to keep it that way. So the debate was excellent, very insightful. It lead to a poll being initiated in the system on Monday. And that poll offered three different selections for voters to choose from, leaving the stability fee at zero percent, raising the stability fee by two percent or by four percent. So there was three options that could have been chosen.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0732>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=07m32s">07:32</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>We saw some very interesting engagement with the system this week, which was encouraging because last week we talked about apathy and engagement and whether that was a significant risk that needed to be addressed, or whether it was something that was gonna improve over time. And I think that we've seen some numbers that imply that it's going to improve over time. That poll had more active voters than the previous executive vote had. So obviously people are getting out to make decisions when they feel that they have skin in the game, which is a great thing to see. So unless things have changed in the voting portal in the last couple of minutes, I wanna talk about some numbers a bit. We've seen an interesting spread on activity here, so I did some very basic spreadsheeting. I'm not gonna share it because it's embarrassing to expose to the public, but currently for the "Leave Things As They Are" poll, we're seeing one point five percent of the total Maker stakes for that option. For the "two percent raise", we're at 22.9% in support as far as staked MKR, but the overwhelming lead is for the "four percent increase", so we've seen 75.6% of the total MKR staked allocated to the third option of raising it by four percent, which is interesting. I would not have predicted that, but that is governance for you in a nutshell.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0912>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=09m12s">09:12</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>One of the things that I wanted to look at this time was also the distribution of voters as well. So not just ... obviously the system is based around skin in the game, but there's interesting metrics to be pulled by figuring out how many people were involved, and what the distribution of MKR per voter was. I don't have the distribution numbers ready yet, but as far as voters per option, we're seeing a very interesting alignment. So for the "Leave Things As They Are" option, eight percent of the individual voters selected that one. For the "two percent raise" we saw 17% of people voting for that. For the "four percent raise", 73%. So there's this interesting alignment with not only the amount of MKR that was staked, but the number of people that chose these options as well, which I hadn't really expected. Because when it comes to a skin in the game sort of system, there's always going to be this lingering, either resentment fear or encouragement, so that's the people with the most to lose are the ones that are most active in these votes. And I think that we've seen a fairly good distribution of people signaling their intentions, regardless of whether they are a whale or not. Which implies that we have a healthy system developing right now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1044>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=10m44s">10:44</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So that's where we stand right now. What that means is that at some point in the next few hours, that votes will time-out, in the next hour and 45 minutes. And then we will have our next step presented to us, and the way things are working right no is tomorrow at 5:00 PM UTC, we will be putting the winning poll into an executive vote, which will be a four percent increase too 7.5%, unless there's a last minute shift in the landscape. Which is obviously always possible, and I think that's one of the interesting things that I discovered a few minutes before this call, is that there's been a fantastic amount of movement according to token analysts, in Maker, in the last 24 hours. So it's entirely possible that we might see some interesting shifts before tomorrow. Or we might see that this is just people preparing to reinforce the way that the polls already moved.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1151>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=11m51s">11:51</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>Quick question Rich. What percent, if you have this handy, what percent of the market capitalization of MKR is staked for this vote, and is there a historical line we could look at?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1203>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=12m03s">12:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Well, I don't know and no, but here's the good news. One of the things that we've been talking about a great deal a lot is both in these calls and also outside of them, is that there's a requirement for tooling in the system. We need community facing tooling, we need some more sophisticated chart tooling, so those numbers will be coming. I did it last week in the r/mkrgov thread, that recapped the events of that executive vote. And I'll make sure that, that's included on this one as well. So it would be a good number to capture.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1239>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=12m39s">12:39</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Richard, I got a question. Do you think it's a good idea to schedule a governance poll so that they end in the few hours leading up to the weekly governance call? Is that something that's-</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1252>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=12m52s">12:52</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>[crosstalk 00:12:52]. It should have, but it didn't, because this is another ... In the interest of radical transparency, let's talk about the problems that are involved with governance. From the outside looking in, it's not a big deal. From the inside looking out, my God, it's hard. We're auditing the entire system right now, and it's our goal to be able to turn around an entire governance cycle in less than seven days. So that includes starting off with a call, making it into a debate in Reddit, giving people time to discover what it is that we're talking about, then going into a governance poll, then going into an executive vote, then going into another governance weekly. In order to do that, we've identified, I think there's 37 or 40 individual steps involved with that process, from writing the spells for the blockchain to making sure that the Reddit post and the Twitter notifications are out there, to having these calls. There's a significant number of stakeholders involved as well. So we're very, very energetically attempting to optimize that process and audit it as much as we possibly can.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1403>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=14m03s">14:03</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Yeah, [crosstalk 00:14:03].</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1403>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=14m03s">14:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>[crosstalk 00:14:03] it will be over.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1405>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=14m05s">14:05</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>I think one thing that would be good to get feedback from the community maybe right now, is the length of the governance poll.

The other thing that we've been thinking about is the commitment drop off, so as over time ... let me collect my thoughts. So if we see that there's less than X percent of MKR stated over the last six hour period, then we can assume that people have petered out their level of interest. But it's very, very difficult to create arbitrary ranges on these things, and it might be more useful just to simply publish the fact that, "Hey, there's a poll, you have two days to make your voices heard." And then that's the end of the story.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1528>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=15m28s">15:28</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>Yep.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1529>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=15m29s">15:29</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Well there's pretty deliberate reasons for not using a quorum, right Rich?

We haven't really gotten into the weeds in voting yet, because ... and I don't wanna clear, cloud the discussion yet. We're gonna get to these things, but there's all kinds of risks involved with these things. And there's collusion, there's vote buying, there's ... Well, I don't wanna list them all, but yeah, there's a lot of reasons why on chain voting might be fraught with peril. And I think that as these discussions continue, we're gonna start to identify those and modify the system as required, but for now this is what we have and it seems to be working fairly well. But we're gonna have a Q&amp;A session at the end of the call, and that's why I'm talking so quickly and hoping to move things along.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1624>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=16m24s">16:24</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I wanna get to risk and have Cyrus review the current state of the system and then after that I wanna open up the floor to just any question at all, including governance questions.

Let me do a quick screen share. All right so, as most of you are aware, we did not see any significant strengthening of DAI price this last week. Early on I think, right when the governance poll started, we saw ... or right after the governance call last week, we saw a slight increase. Things were recovering for a bit, and then as the week carried on, just receded back down. We saw a fairly flat ETH price, we saw fairly flat inventory levels. I'm fairly sure that our inventory levels remained unchanged. I'm not sure about other market makers, if they wanna chime in they can. We are also in the process of working on some plan to proof of inventory from various market makers exploring a process from a technical level. In terms of other statistics, here we can see some CDP stats. We did see significant DAI wipes yesterday, about almost a million and a half in the past 24 hours. We did see a slight drop off in the DAI supply, which is a positive sign. One of the few positive signs we've seen.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1822>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=18m22s">18:22</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>This is likely ... this happened when the result of the governance poll was determined. It will be interesting to see if that trend continues when the executive poll is run. In terms of tooling, as Rich mentioned, we are working hard behind the scenes to get this process streamlined better, better data visualization, statistical measures. We will be open sourcing data, and our models. The eventual goal is to create some sort of risk dashboard that we can all convene on, that</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1900>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=19m00s">19:00</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>... compiles all the data that we just keep talking about week after week. It's a work in progress, and it will be coming soon hopefully. Let's see. That's it for data. In terms of some other minor things. I think for the governance polls, the increments we used last week seem to have been ... were well received. The zero, two, and four offered a few extra choices for people. The increments of 2% step sizes also seems like it was well received. So I'm hoping that that's the beginning of a template for now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1948>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=19m48s">19:48</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>I think that's it for me.

Cyrus, you mentioned that inventories were flat despite the fact that we drift back, we drifted back down even slightly below where we were prior to the last stability fee increase. That on its own would be surprising to me, as you'd expect there to be accumulating at that lower price, though if inventories are flat, that could tell us that they're not accumulating additional inventories potentially because they're saturated. Is that something that you've heard from other market makers? Do you have a sense for why that might be happening?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2234>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=22m34s">22:34</a></td> <td align=left>Joe Quintilian</td> <td align=left>I think a lot of the inventories are saturated right now.

That doesn't happen very often, so it's kind of stayed steady and slightly improved. I can graph this on a different axis next time so it's easier to see, but you see that supply volume had been coming down, but now borrow volume has also taken a small downturn. So these are not great indicators, and honestly a little bit confusing given that we increased the stability fee, which should theoretically have reduced the oversupply and improved both of these metrics, but we've actually kind of seen a little bit of the opposite of what we expected.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2743>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=27m43s">27:43</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So I'm not sure if that's a case necessarily for just a stronger increase.

As the eco system grows, as the use cases of DAI kind of broaden out to non-trading and non-leveraged use cases, we should hopefully see less of a correlation, less importance based on inventories and so forth.

Even if there isn't a move it still could have a potential effect if for example there's a large demand for leverage and the DAI community's impact on that is only X% of the outstanding Ether versus the 1 minus X% of utilitarian use of Ether outweighing that in some way. If there's a small decline of 95% of Ether demand, but a large increase in the 5%, the total price could be flat.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#3129>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=31m29s">31:29</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>Right.

And so essentially that has kind of stayed at about the level of the stability fee, where generally over time, when the stability fee has moved, the interest rates have moved as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#3214>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=32m14s">32:14</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So that's sort of interesting to note that it's actually kind of held around 3.45, 3.5 even though the stability fee is right there as well. So that gap has closed, but the ETH borrow rate, the interest rate on Compound is actually fairly low. So it's pretty cheap, and I think there's relatively low demand for borrowing ETH. I think we could speculate on what the demand is for ETH, but really the interesting thing is as price volatility of ETH drops, I do think that hurts to some extent the demand for DAI because people are less worried about getting their CDPs liquidated, and so they're less likely to pay back debt. So that's also going to be a natural function of this kind of ETH price stability that's continued.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#3308>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=33m08s">33:08</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>That raises some interesting points too, because this has been sort of a constant source of amazement for me with the crypto space in general is that it flips the script on based on ... compared to traditional finance.

In blockchain space you know what people are doing, you don't know who or why they're doing it necessarily, and I think that this is ... it's a tricky situation for us to be in because we're trying to anticipate people's requirements and trying to create sort of these game theoretical levers without entirely knowing why people are in this system in the first place, and I think that this is one of the challenges that we have.

And create some thought experiments to try and anticipate what that means, because if I'm a large CDP holder, and I'm long ETH, or I am seeking [inaudible 00:34:26] DAI in order to gain interest somewhere else, how does a stability fee actually effect me?

There's a difference in looking at the stability fee, and looking at the savings rate, looking at the interest rate that is provided. You make different decisions, like, if you had to take a loan from a bank, and the bank said, "You can take this loan out for five years, and do whatever you want, but the rate is X, and then, at the end of five years, you have to pay ... when you pay it back, when you return this, you also have to give me another 3.5%."</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4244>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceSfBZEBfbE&t=42m44s">42:44</a></td> <td align=left>Barron Gati</td> <td align=left>That is treated very differently than the coupon payments you would have to make during the loan.

And if, right now, we have a pulling method, where people that are engaged in the system are expected to maintain their positions, and understand exactly how that money is being controlled or contained.
