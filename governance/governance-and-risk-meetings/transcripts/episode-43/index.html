everyone, welcome to the July 11<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting. My name is Richard Brown, I'm head of community developments. We're going to be talking about risk and governance in this call today. We have a special presentation from Cyrus, he's continuing his presentation of the general model for us. I want to... sorry, I shouldn't skip people.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000030></a><a href=#000030>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h00m30s">00:00:30</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Vishesh will be presenting his Visheshalytics, when he tells us about the state of the peg. And then Matthew Rabinowitz will be giving us his weekly recap, sorry, or the weekly narrative towards the end of the hour possibly afterwards. I want to keep momentum up though, so let's scramble through the preamble here.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000052></a><a href=#000052>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h00m52s">00:00:52</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>If you have something to say, please say it. Don't be shy. If you have a microphone let's leverage that capacity. If you don't have a microphone please type your questions in the chat. And either David and I will be monitoring that and we'll ask the questions for you when we get a chance. Or you can just storm up in there and then after the hour we're going to hanging around for another 30 minutes to just a do a general Q&amp;A. Everyone's more than welcome to hang around for that.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000120></a><a href=#000120>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h01m20s">00:01:20</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I think that's going to be it for the preambles right now. I'm going to jump in to what I want to talk about, and hopefully not burn up too much time. We have a new forum and that forum was long overdue. There's all kinds of reasons why we waited a bit. I think that that worked out well. There was a critical mass of content that was ready to go, and so we have people jumping into the forum and I could not be happier with how well it has turned out. The content in there is amazing. The way that people were coming together and figuring out what needs to be done, and how we should be doing it is extremely impressive.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000159></a><a href=#000159>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h01m59s">00:01:59</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>If anybody in this call hasn't checked it out yet, I highly recommend that you do. I'm typing in the URL that's basically discoverable forum at MakerDAO. Have a look and contribute wherever you can. What I want to talk about today though is merchant processes and workflows and communities. Those are three different things, when you combine them they get even more complicated.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000231></a><a href=#000231>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h02m31s">00:02:31</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>One of the things that I want us as a group to begin to think about is, how do we surface valuable information, how do we collect that information, where does that information live, and how do we all work together? These are all super hard questions. To give you some context though we've been solving them slowly over time and introducing them one by one, and now it's time to start putting those pieces together.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000258></a><a href=#000258>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h02m58s">00:02:58</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The pieces that we have are these calls. We have... yeah, let's break them down as we go. So we have these calls. These calls are very small time window, they're all held in English. They're in North American friendly time zones.

The DSR isn't actually live, and so this value transfer doesn't work as we'd like it to. And this has led to, potentially, a higher than normal stability fee. Now, in addition to this fee associated with helping keep DAI stable, there's also this element of credit risk associated with the CDP. And this is a risk compensation, also paid by the borrower, but to the MKR token holders. And we call this the risk premium or the risk premium rate.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001644></a><a href=#001644>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=00h16m44s">00:16:44</a></td> <td>Cyrus</td> <td>The collateral risk models which we've been discussing the last couple weeks, and the next couple weeks, are all designed to cover this latter risk premium, not so much the DSR.

Well, I think it's pretty clear that it was actually due to the supplier expansion, right? As a community, we've never really even talked about the potential collateral risk of ETH DAI launched with 0.5% stability fee.

So, as we approach MCD launch, we got to start thinking about how that DSR portion of the stability fee will evolve once the DSR is actually functioning, and how we're going to handle the risk premium rate.

But then we will have to add back what is the problem reflection of credit risk for the CDP due to the collateral backing it.

May was kind of an explosion for the secondary lending platforms. June has been a steady increase in borrow volume, and supply volume as well.

And so this does tend to pretty closely correspond with those rates. Because a lot of these platforms actually just algorithmically set rates based on what this "cashflow" is.

Although a little bit of dip now recently, as people heard that 18.5% was coming around the bend. So the excess has decreased as DAI got more expensive, which made sense. But initially, it was running up with that DAI supply. That was interesting, potentially people purchasing DAI from others who were selling it for leverage, and then relending it on secondary lending platforms just to get a little bit extra interest.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012346></a><a href=#012346>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=01h23m46s">01:23:46</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So this last graph, just basically, makes this one around the utilization rates. So I had looked at this initially to see if there is a relationship between the stability fee and the utilization rates on the secondary lending platforms.

But during the time period when the stability fee is flat, you also do see some pretty solid fluctuation in these rates. So what I'm basically saying is, when the stability fee has being changed, or other significant monetary policy components are being changed on Maker, you need to wait, I think, for some of these metrics to settle on the secondary lending platforms.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012442></a><a href=#012442>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=01h24m42s">01:24:42</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But whilst all is quiet on the Western front, then you do tend to see some potentially leading indicators that you can listen to around what's going on in terms of basically oversupply. And so, it's been a complex, I think, point to touch on. Some people talking about, "To what extent is this supply, people who've leveraged out of DAI and sold it and other people who are just purchasing it and lending. Versus people who are actually drawing DAI out, and then holding on to it, and in the meantime, actually lending it out of these secondary lending platforms."</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012518></a><a href=#012518>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=01h25m18s">01:25:18</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>One of the data points that I think will be helpful to illuminate that, which... Sorry, I was looking for a tab that I recently closed. Okay, I'll also go back to it in a second, but I'll just verbally describe. So the transaction volume on DAI has actually been pretty huge lately. So over the course of the last month or so, here, the transaction volume is been...

So since then you've seen a pretty significant increase in that transaction volume. Which is, I think, a positive indicator for people who are... It's significantly outpaced the increase in trading volume during that time. So it's not just attributable to trading volume. So I think that's a pretty positive indicator for people who are wanting to look at, to what extent is diet being used and transacted on outside of just being traded for leverage? Because it does appear to have picked up fairly significantly.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012643></a><a href=#012643>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=01h26m43s">01:26:43</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So the other last point that I want to touch on, and sorry for taking up extra time here, but the liquidations. Some people have talked about, "Oh, there was a significant amount of liquidations recently." Just want to put that in perspective. The liquidations recently have been, yes present, but overall in the grand scheme of things not huge. And have actually been at fairly high collateralization ratios. So this can potentially be attributable to less volatility in the ETH price, although I think we know that's not true.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012716></a><a href=#012716>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlH0bMvqO9w&t=01h27m16s">01:27:16</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>The ETH price has drop significantly recently, but I think also attributable to the fact that there was a higher overall collateralization ratio recently than there had been in the past.

And there are sometimes changes to the collateralization ratio, and liquidations in the same block in the same transaction hash. And so, ordering those events properly is sometimes a little bit tricky. And ordering them also in the same block price tick because there tends to be liquidation in the block that there is a price tick.

But pretty much every data set, there's just one liquidation I've kept my eyes on. Happened early on, and it happened at 154% collateralization.

But I think those are very small CDPs were that rounding error can make things seem a little bit more extreme than it is. So accepting those cases, buying large, yeah, I think the collateralizations have all been in this range, roughly.

All right, thanks everybody.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </article> </div> </div> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-footer-copyright> Made with <a href=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ target=_blank rel=noopener> Material for MkDocs </a> </div> <div class=md-footer-social> <a href=https://github.com/maker/community target=_blank rel=noopener title=github.com class=md-footer-social__link> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 496 512"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"/></svg> </a> <a href=https://twitter.com/MakerDAO target=_blank rel=noopener title=twitter.com class=md-footer-social__link> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M459.37 151.716c.325 4.548.325 9.097.325 13.645 0 138.72-105.583 298.558-298.558 298.558-59.452 0-114.68-17.219-161.137-47.106 8.447.974 16.568 1.299 25.34 1.299 49.055 0 94.213-16.568 130.274-44.832-46.132-.975-84.792-31.188-98.112-72.772 6.498.974 12.995 1.624 19.818 1.624 9.421 0 18.843-1.3 27.614-3.573-48.081-9.747-84.143-51.98-84.143-102.985v-1.299c13.969 7.797 30.214 12.67 47.431 13.319-28.264-18.843-46.781-51.005-46.781-87.391 0-19.492 5.197-37.36 14.294-52.954 51.655 63.675 129.3 105.258 216.365 109.807-1.624-7.797-2.599-15.918-2.599-24.04 0-57.828 46.782-104.934 104.934-104.934 30.213 0 57.502 12.67 76.67 33.137 23.715-4.548 46.456-13.32 66.599-25.34-7.798 24.366-24.366 44.833-46.132 57.827 21.117-2.273 41.584-8.122 60.426-16.243-14.292 20.791-32.161 39.308-52.628 54.253z"/></svg> </a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src=../../../../assets/javascripts/vendor.241d0c29.min.js></script> <script src=../../../../assets/javascripts/bundle.05dbdb2b.min.js></script><script id=__lang type=application/json>{"search.config.lang": "en", "clipboard.copy": "Copy to clipboard", "search.result.none": "No matching documents", "search.result.other": "# matching documents", "search.config.separator": "[\\s\\-]+", "search.result.placeholder": "Type to start searching", "search.config.pipeline": "trimmer, stopWordFilter", "clipboard.copied": "Copied to clipboard", "search.result.one": "1 matching document"}</script> <script>
