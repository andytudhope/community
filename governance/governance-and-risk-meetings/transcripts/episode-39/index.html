Welcome to the June 13<sup>th</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of community developments at MakerDAO.

There you go. Cyrus Younessi, the head of risk, will be walking us through collateral risk today. I'm not going to steal his thunder. I'll let him get into that. I have some things that I'd like to say at the top of the call though. I want to make sure that people are as engaged as we can possibly incite them to be in these meetings. So, in the group chats, I've posted a link to a reddit thread. In that reddit thread, every week, we post a summary of the call.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000055></a><a href=#000055>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h00m55s">00:00:55</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>All the interesting points, David has been kind enough to actually recap the entire thing for us. He also provides links to timestamps in the YouTube video, so it's easy for people to get catch up, get caught up with what's been going on. In that thread, we continue the discussion for the rest of the weea k and this is meme I keep on hitting over and over and over again.

But we don't make decisions here, whenever possible, I guess. Then we continue the debate in mediums that have a longer life cycle, or lifespan, than these one hour calls in North American friendly time zones. And currently, that's Reddit. If we surface some important issues, get into reddit, that reddit thread, debate with us. We'll come up with some conclusions, test the temperature of the community and see how things move on from there.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000157></a><a href=#000157>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h01m57s">00:01:57</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We'll be introducing new tooling in the future that's a bit more sophisticated than what reddit has to offer at this point, but we haven't quite outgrown it yet. In the interim, continue the debate there. Preamble number two, we are extremely interested in hearing everybody's opinion in these calls. We have a lot of really smart people here. These calls aren't designed to be me, Cyrus, Vishesh talking. They're designed for us to talk and moderate.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000226></a><a href=#000226>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=00h02m26s">00:02:26</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>It's our hope that the smart people on this call will be asking questions, at every conceivable opportunity.

You can have 20 different people come out of the same call with different ideas of what a rough consensus is. The reason why we have a polling system is so we don't need to rely on rough consensus.

And based on what's been going on with some of the secondary lending rates in the past 24 hours or so, I think that was more of the latter where people were levering up in anticipation of a bit of a jump in ETH price, which actually self-fulfilled within a 24 hour timescale.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010206></a><a href=#010206>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=01h02m06s">01:02:06</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So, yeah, to talk a little bit about the relationship between DAI and ETH price.

So, essentially as the stability fee is continually increasing from 11.5 to 19.5%, there was a pretty steady drop in supply. That stayed stagnant all through the 17.5% decrease, but then around the 16.5% decrease, that started to tick back up a little bit. And has now come up a little bit further, but that's probably a short term effect from what's been going on with ETH price.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010409></a><a href=#010409>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=01h04m09s">01:04:09</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So in general, it's … Again Rich asked me this question all the time, how do we decide what is confidence in terms of a trend versus a short term movement? Like I said, I think time is what generally tells us that. So, as we look at more of these like long run averages I think will get clearer pictures. But, my initial sense is with the 17.5% decrease, there wasn't a huge effect. But with the 16.5% decrease, there has been a little bit of a ticking up in the DIA supply and the amount of leverage that people have been seeking.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010451></a><a href=#010451>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdpqqMZRNg&t=01h04m51s">01:04:51</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Now, that leverage that they've been seeking is not just been on Maker.

Once we hit that 19.5% mark, there started to be a legitimate impact where that debt started to come down significantly.
