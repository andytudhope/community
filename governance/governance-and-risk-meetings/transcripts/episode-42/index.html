Hey everybody, welcome to the July 4<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk meeting with MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I am the head of community development. I will be moderating today's call. We're not going to have a huge turnout. Apparently there's some kind of holiday going on somewhere, so we're going to plow ahead with what we have on our schedule, talk about the peg. We're going to hear from Matthew about his weekly narrative. I'm going to talk a bit about a secret forum that we have. That was my big teaser to try and generate some traffic today. Did not work, but we'll talk about it anyways.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000042></a><a href=#000042>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QDgbgfG8qc&t=00h00m42s">00:00:42</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>As always, excuse me, we're intensely interested in hearing from our community, so if you have question, type it in the chat. If you have a microphone, jump right in and let us know what you're thinking.

Something interesting happened in the poll, and I want to call this out, because this is a recurring theme that we discussed over and over in these meetings. That is voter turnout and what does that actually mean, what's the impact of it, what is continuous approval voting, how do we put the signals in the system and why are those important?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000128></a><a href=#000128>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QDgbgfG8qc&t=00h01m28s">00:01:28</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Excuse me, I have a cough today.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000130></a><a href=#000130>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QDgbgfG8qc&t=00h01m30s">00:01:30</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>It's important for numerous reasons, but today we saw an example that's happened a couple of times in the past, which points out one of these edge cases, and one of these edge cases is that if you don't believe that your vote matters, then somebody else's vote does. It's a hard lesson to learn and it's one that people need to internalize, especially in this ecosystem.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000151></a><a href=#000151>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QDgbgfG8qc&t=00h01m51s">00:01:51</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>But up until early this morning, there was a fairly clear signal that the voters had been interested in raising the stability fee by 1% to 17.5%.

So it's yet another reminder that people should do their best to keep their hands on the wheel when it comes to these polls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000240></a><a href=#000240>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QDgbgfG8qc&t=00h02m40s">00:02:40</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I don't want to dig into it too much.

And that cost is just how easy and profitable is it to use Maker through CDPs, which is the stability fee, that stability fee, like 100% determines profitability. And so it's the trade-off between kind of tightening the variability in the system, versus allowing growth to happen a little bit easier.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001650></a><a href=#001650>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QDgbgfG8qc&t=00h16m50s">00:16:50</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But I think what we'll see is that growth has been happening despite 19.5% stability fee, 17.5, et cetera.

Because once burned, twice shy, they don't want to get liquidated, but to some extent, other people, especially on the higher range of collateralizations I think tend to do pull out some of that collateral, so that they can realize some of their profits, pay back other loans, whatever they're going to do with that capital.
