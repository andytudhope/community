Welcome to the June 20<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting with MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of the community development. I keep on forgetting that. I believe that's accurate.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000017></a><a href=#000017>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h00m17s">00:00:17</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We're going to be tightening up the agenda slightly because we have a significant amount of science to crank through. Cyrus Younessi is going to introduce us to the wonderful world of collateral risk and everything that entails. I'm not going to describe any more than that because I'll probably use the wrong terminology, so I'll allow him to keep us informed. We'll hear from Vishesh about the state of the peg briefly for about 10 minutes. Cyrus, we're going to dig into his slideshow for the bulk of the call.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000050></a><a href=#000050>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h00m50s">00:00:50</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I am going to restrict myself to five minutes of preamble today, so I'm going to talk real fast. If you have questions, comments, please do not feel shy. Jump right in. We have a chat. Type your questions in the chat if you don't have access to a microphone. If you do have access to a microphone, interrupt us whenever you need to and we can have the discussions as they arise. I think that's probably it for the boiler plates. I want to talk briefly about governance issues because we're seeing some interesting things happening again.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000126></a><a href=#000126>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h01m26s">00:01:26</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Our polls this week up until the 11<sup>th</sup> hour was weighted towards a 15.5% stability fee, so the community has signaled for lowering it by 1%, and we might have seen the first example of an emergent behavior, which I'm happy about. We might've seen campaigning for the first time, which is great because this is something that we need to encourage as group and support whenever possible.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000155></a><a href=#000155>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h01m55s">00:01:55</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>People need to be involved with the system. They need to know that their involvement can affect people's opinions. It can affect the way that the system works. We had some people pop up in the chat yesterday saying, "OMG, why are people advocating for a lower stability fee?" There was a conversation there. People dug into the graphs and then somebody posted a thread in r/mkrgov saying essentially the same thing. Why are you all advocating for lowering the fee when it should be raised?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000231></a><a href=#000231>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h02m31s">00:02:31</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>People, there was a comment or two, but I don't know if this is coincidental or not, but the weight staked in that poll had moved since that post went up, and now it's advocating for a 1% increase. We'll leave it to Vishesh to present data about whether that seems to be the most logical option.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000254></a><a href=#000254>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h02m54s">00:02:54</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>What I'm far more interested in, though, is the fact that people determined that the system was moving in a way that they didn't like. They piped up. They had some chats, they made some posts, and then the system changed, and that's very encouraging to me. That's the sunshine aspect. Here's the contrarian view here. We're still in a situation where we're running into voter apathy, and this isn't a surprise. It's not something we weren't prepared for. This is the nature of the game, and we have some questions I think that we need to ask ourselves specifically related to the cadence of voting, the friction associated with voting, our expectation or requirements that the community needs to be engaged on a weekly basis, and they need to education themselves, stay up to date, and then move their keys and/or find their keys and then move their Maker every Friday.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000357></a><a href=#000357>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h03m57s">00:03:57</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>There's seems to be a different sentiment in the community about that's just the nature of the beast and that's what people need to do. I'm not sure that I'm convinced to do that, and one of the thought experiments that I do, and this is not a complicated one, I ask myself, "Rich, name five projects in the space that you'd be willing to do the same thing for," and the answer is none. I would not do that for any project in this space, so we need to determine whether that's a realistic expectation for asking people to interact with our system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000428></a><a href=#000428>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h04m28s">00:04:28</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I don't want to sound too prejudicial. I think that there's middle ground. There's other options that we can explore, and one of those things that I would like to refer everybody's attention to is a recap of these thoughts that I've posted in the r/mkrgov subreddit. Is somebody talking about Rich without a hat? Yeah, today is my baldy reminder day just so it's not a big surprise if I take my hat off six months from now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000456></a><a href=#000456>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h04m56s">00:04:56</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>All right, so I'm posting a link in the chat. This recapped some of the questions that we'd asked previously, so they come from the community, come from me, come from these discussions. Are we seeing engagement fatigue? Is 1% increments too fine-grained? Are 10 plus polling options too confusing? Are people tempted to fiddle with the rate if we're moving things up and down by 1%? Are we asking people to vote on weekends? Well, we are. Is that a bad idea or does that not matter? The list of questions go on and on and on. I'm not going to read them all out because I promised I would only talk for five minutes and I've already broken that promise.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000536></a><a href=#000536>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfXtvCplwc&t=00h05m36s">00:05:36</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The interesting thing about this is that it puts us into a situation where we have one signaling method available to us and that's the poll in voting portal.
