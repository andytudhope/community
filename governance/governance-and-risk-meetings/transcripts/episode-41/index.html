everybody to the June 27<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting at MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of Community Development. I have a few things that I like to say at the top of each call, and I'm going to continue to say them. I've posted a link in the group chat. It's a link to our discussion thread. So, every week we have these calls. These calls last for an hour, an hour-and-a-half. We talk about a lot of really interesting things. Too many interesting things to actually dig into each one of them, so we continue these discussions in our subreddit, and we also post summaries of the calls there, for people who weren't able to attend, which are wonderfully detailed and recently have included pictures as well, so if you want to get caught up, if you want to get people caught up with the things that you've said and asked, follow that thread because we post summaries, and the conversation continues.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000056></a><a href=#000056>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h00m56s">00:00:56</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>In these calls particularly though, we have tons and tons and tons to go over, but we're also extremely interested in hearing from the community and the voters, so if you have a question that you want to have answered, please type it in the chat at the side. If you have access to a microphone, please just jump in and ask questions whenever they occur to you. We're pretty good about handling interruptions. If it turns out that we're in the middle of a flow though, we'll circle back afterwards, but we love the back and forth, so please speak up if you have something to say.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000128></a><a href=#000128>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h01m28s">00:01:28</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Traditionally in these calls, I spend the first what I usually claim to be five minutes talking about governance. It rarely ends up being that efficient. Happily, today though, everybody is spared that because I've been racking my brains to think about what I can talk about, and I probably shouldn't be looking for reasons to waste time in these calls, so here's the short answer.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000149></a><a href=#000149>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h01m49s">00:01:49</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Governance seems to be working the way it's supposed to, which is cool. For the last three or four weeks, the voters have signaled for no change. The stability fee seems to be doing what it's supposed to do. We have a large, longer-tail conversation about whether the cadence is correct, whether the stepping is correct, whether we should ... there are 10 or 15 various tweaks that we could talk about for governance. Those conversations about how we could change governance lasted for a while, and it's probably going to be superseded by an improvement in the governance portal, which will make some of these debates moot, so I'm not going to dig back into those today.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000230></a><a href=#000230>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h02m30s">00:02:30</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I am going to hand it off almost immediately to Cyrus Younessi, and we can start talking about some risk. Cyrus, it's all yours.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000241></a><a href=#000241>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h02m41s">00:02:41</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>Sure. Same schedule today. Think we'll start off with the monetary policy stuff from Vishesh, and then we'll jump into the next phase of collateral risk. Pretty simple. Vishesh, are you on the call?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000301></a><a href=#000301>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h03m01s">00:03:01</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Yeah.

Can we see everything all right? So, all in all, it's been a pretty interesting week, I think. Just to touch on the state of the peg real quick, it's been fairly steady. There's been kind of a slight drift, and a slight increase in variance over the past month or so, but nothing to be worried about, and I think this was part of the discussion around, that spread is easier to widen when the stability fee is lower, because there's a little bit less pressure, and I think that's something we can double click on later.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000359></a><a href=#000359>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h03m59s">00:03:59</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But more importantly is, in the past 24 hours or so, there's been a huge spike in trading volume, and DAI price has actually done pretty all right in the face of that. It seems that there is some profit booking from ETH rising, which is really interesting, because actually, there's a little bit of a time delay on this graph, the time cut-off was at around 14 million.

What's interesting is generally when there's that profit booking happening, you'll see a commensurate decrease in DAI supply, or at least a commensurate rise in collateralization ratio, because people get scared of those liquidations, and they punch in a little bit more collateral, but also the price went down, so in nominal terms all the collateral decreased in value as well, so those kind of balance out, where in the extremely short term you would see a bit of a drop in collateralization, and then you will see it rise up as a counter effect.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000754></a><a href=#000754>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h07m54s">00:07:54</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So, as far as the supply, it's been rising somewhat consistently since ... 17.5%, then 16.5%.

So, one of the interesting things is the stability fee also has an impact on what happens with secondary lending, and so to some extent, you saw an increase from maybe two million DAI being supplied on secondary lending platforms to about 14 in that same sort of time span. This is a shorter time span graph, but it's still that May to June period.

And I do want to touch on the fees in a bit, I'll pull that out, but also you do see this interesting pattern of a continual accrual of unpaid fees, and some periodic jumps in fees getting paid back. And there appears to be a bit of periodicity emerging, in terms of when fees get paid back, when new CDPs get opened, when old CDPs get closed out.

So what's interesting is during that same time frame of this run up, we saw far fewer draws happening on new CDPs versus old, so more of the debt that was being pulled out of Maker was being pulled out of preexisting CDPs, and presumably because the overall outstanding loan amount was continually increasing during that time, that more of those new loans were coming from secondary lending platforms.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001823></a><a href=#001823>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h18m23s">00:18:23</a></td> <td>David Utrobin</td> <td>Vishesh, I have a quick question about the graph right above this one.

I think as the ETH price has continually been rising over time, people have perceived this greater height to fall from, and so they've kept a little bit more collateral in the system. What's interesting to note is in the past 24, 48 hours, a ton of collateral has been freed from the system. This is not even with liquidations and such, but also people have pulled out some collateral. And that tends to happen when the ETH price goes up, because presumably as the stability fee was reduced, 17, 16, around here, this 450-ish level was something that people were presumably comfortable with.

Well, maybe 2% is a fairly good starting point for what you expect the company that you're looking at is likely to default on its debt.

They draw K debt, they pay a stability fee, s, and maintain a collateralization ratio of V over K, which we'll call X. We'll also define the whole space of user behavior just by F for now. We're probably not going to talk too much about user behavior today, because I don't think we'll have time, but essentially we have to account for the fact that users, as I mentioned, can add or subtract collateral or pay down or draw more DAI.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003344></a><a href=#003344>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h33m44s">00:33:44</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>This is important because CDPs are not static, so if you have a CDP that has a liquidation price of 200, I think as we all know, as we approach that 200 price point, users will tend to take action that will push their liquidation price lower.

All right, in addition to standard user behavior of trying to avoid liquidations, there are some technical edge cases as well, in particular the oracle security module, which has a one hour price feed delay, so essentially if the collateral asset just completely plummets, users are incentivized to draw as much DAI as possible, since the collateral's worthless anyway, so we need to be cognizant of this as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003543></a><a href=#003543>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h35m43s">00:35:43</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>So, the time horizon of CDP is well known.

A CDP is liquidated with probability Q, and so this is the probability that that T1 threshold is reached before our one-year time horizon, so this is definitely something critical that we're interested in.

Somewhat arbitrary variables. This represents loss given default, or one minus loss given default. And as we all know, this represents the slippage adjustment for when you liquidate the collateral. The less slippage there is, the higher amount of the debt that you recover. And then of course we have this amount offset by the liquidation penalty as well, or I should say, added back in. r is the risk-free rate, from traditional world. Plays a role. And our credit spread, which is essentially what we're solving for, is defined by s minus r, and we'll ignore DSR adjustments for now. And the expected loss of a single CDP, which is what ultimately we're trying to solve for here, is the product of these three variables.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003859></a><a href=#003859>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=00h38m59s">00:38:59</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>Probably all good.

So we already know we want to solve for probabilities, losses and exposure amounts, and we need to develop some intuition around the asset price and user behavior. Standard approach to modeling an asset price is to apply what's known as a stochastic process, which we'll talk about in a second, and it just helps us understand the asset in a variety of ways.

I think there are advantages and disadvantages to both, and in some cases we can even do a hybrid. To clarify that a bit, if you think about that corporate debt example I used a few slides ago, it's not always easy or even possible to actually model the underlying assets that is behind debt. Sometimes you can only just look at it from the debt level, and try to model how the debt behaves over time, or historically, or in some cases, such as our CDPs with ETH, you can actually model the underlying asset, which I think gives us an advantage. But there could very easily come a time where the collateral that is put into CDPs is just a representation, right? It's not something that can be modeled directly, or easily.

And I'm going to impose a bunch of assumptions right now, and then relax them slowly, because it's a lot to do it all at once. So I'm going to ignore user behavior for now. The ability for users to add or remove collateral at will at any time, and to add or subtract DAI at any time, makes things really complicated. It causes a lot of headache. Just adds a lot of complexity, which is what makes MakerDAO such an awesome protocol, right?

It's potentially not great for assets that don't have a lot of historical data, and in many ways, looking at empirical models would be better in some regards, because I think it could have a better tail distribution, but as I've mentioned, it doesn't necessarily factor in the right qualitative risk characteristics, so I think some ideal blend could be combining the empirical with some sensible, qualitative risk adjustment, and then, interestingly enough, there is also a thing called "expert models," where you can just defer to somebody who claims to know what they're talking about, but we won't be doing that one, unless you guys want Rich to just determine all the risk parameters by himself.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010054></a><a href=#010054>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=01h00m54s">01:00:54</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>That's it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010055></a><a href=#010055>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=01h00m55s">01:00:55</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>All right.

So let's say the stability fee was 14, 13%. You hit that debt ceiling because somebody minted a bunch of DAI. People can continue to source DAI, theoretically, from secondary lending platforms, to the extent that that supply exists, but if you increase the stability fee, you may also reduce the supply that exists on those secondary lending platforms, and you may not necessarily reduce the DAI supply.

The stability fee works well when the relative rates on other platforms are two to three percent lower, let's say, or there's a decent buffer range. If they started to run up to be equal to the stability fee for some reason, or even higher, then increasing the stability fee might not solve your problem at all, and so it's a really complex kind of problem, and so I would caution away from thinking that if you hit the debt ceiling, okay, just jack up the stability fee and that will fix everything.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011646></a><a href=#011646>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOA-TIOQBs8&t=01h16m46s">01:16:46</a></td> <td>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td>Yeah, and the danger, or the scary part right now, is all the thinking we've constructed thus far under single collateral DAI, and how we use the stability fee.

If you can do that, you don't need to look at any kind of simulation of a normal price path, or log normal price path. Now, it's not right, it's not going to be perfect, to be able to say, "Hey, I've got this estimation of log normal price path, and I'm going to assume that that's the case," right?
