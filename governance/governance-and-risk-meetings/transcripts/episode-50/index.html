All right, the 50<sup>th</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. My name's Richard Brown. I am the head of community development, I lost that for a second.

We're interating over time and things have been going well. I'm happy with these calls. Enormously happy. But, there's still room for improvement and I want to try and raise the signal to noise slightely. And, also mix things up a bit. I'm trying to convince Cyrus that starting with governance every week is unfair because of all the influence there and emphasis we put on the government stuff, and risk kind of gets squeezed sometimes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000101></a><a href=#000101>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h01m01s">00:01:01</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We might be alternating on each one of these calls. Today, we're going to start off with governance, next week, potentially, we'll start off with risk. So everybody has an opportunity to put some emphasis on a part [inaudible 00:01:15] Excuse me. That they find most compelling. Oh yeah, the preamble, I almost forgot. We want to hear from our community, and this is a really great way to get immediate feedback, and it's also a great way to ping people in the foundation.

We don't mind. I think that's it for preambles. Do we have LongForWisdom, he is here? So I'm not going to dig too deeply into all the interesting things that are happening in the forum, although those are mostly some of the things that I want to talk about today. I'll allow him to do the color commentary. But, I am going to remind people that we have two forum polls happening right now that are water shed moments in the epic history of MakerDAO governance. This is the first time that we've had a forum poll that will provide us signal to initiate a governance poll.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000221></a><a href=#000221>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h02m21s">00:02:21</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>This is a long conversation we probably might not get into today, unless people have questions about that, but we needed to figure out how do we initiate a governance poll, and then in order to gather signals from the wider community, the Maker holders sorry. And the question arose, “Well, how do we achieve enough signals to initiate a governance poll in the portal?”. The answer, after a great deal of discussion and back and forth, was the forum is the place to do that. This is the first example of that activity occurring.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000254></a><a href=#000254>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h02m54s">00:02:54</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>After I talk for a bit, I'm going to post some links to those forum threads. Please, familiarize yourselves with the conversations leading up to that poll. Make your voice heard, and then we'll see how governance actually works in practice, which is going to be exciting.

And one of the interesting things we've seen, and I understand completely, is that that kind of a world is tremendously complicated and involves a lot of work. And maybe not everybody wants to do that. And so, if I had to guess, and this is anecdotal, I haven't taken any polls, but the number one requested feature when it comes to the government's ecosystem is some kind of delegation mechanism so people, and kind of be relieved of this enormous responsibility of researching MakerDAO for hours a week every week to figure out what's going on.

I think a great way to move forward would be to follow the same principles that the crypto space and open-source in general has is that MakerDAO generates these financial primitives, it generates contracts, and then the third party, the community, comes in and builds the tooling on those primitives that they'd like to see and I think that we can look at the governance ecosystem in the same way that we've looked at the protocol itself.

I think that's a very compelling idea. I pinged him after I read about his Nest application and suggested, “how about you do something like that for governance?” Because it seems like a really great way for the community to begin to self-organize.

On the forum it mentioned, "Are there risk teams behind the scenes, or what's the actual status update on that?" And I responded that there isn't some hidden behind-the-scenes slew of risk teams waiting in line, and how we envision that to happen is essentially, I think we're going to try to lean on community support, community outreach, not necessarily from our community but communities of the collateral partners.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002344></a><a href=#002344>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h23m44s">00:23:44</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>So, for example if some collateral partner, whether it's a crypto-asset or not, wants to onboard their asset into MCD, basically, currently what's happening is they're just generally coming to us on the interim risk team and saying "We love you guys, we want to become part of the project." And I think on their end, they don't realize that there's essentially 20, 30 independent projects trying to work their way into MCD. And at a certain level it just becomes completely infeasible for us to handle the entire process for all of the project.

But actually, in the last day or two, We did see a little bit more wipe than minting. And then in collateral terms, we saw, things were pretty quiet. But you know, collateral does periodically get added as the price falls. And then we can see here is in terms of liquidations, there were some liquidations recently, but not as much as when ETH dipped about two weeks ago. So that price has been kind of slowly coming down a bit, which I know a lot of people are not happy about.

So some of the cumulative graphs. Essentially, this ETH price has been coming down pretty consistently for the first part of 2019. There was sort of a run up and now it's come back down, again, to basically just end of 2018 levels. Or slightly, slightly below. I mean, it was roughly November, December when the price was last at this level. So what's interesting is the amount of collateral that had been locked in the system was consistently growing, the amount of collateral that was being removed from the system, voluntarily, was actually being outpaced initially in the first part of 2019, and picked up pace in mid-2019, and has now sort of flat lined. And this makes total sense, because essentially, as that ETH price was running up a little bit, There's some excitement, a little bit of re-leveraging, a little bit of taking some collateral out because it had risen in dollar terms. And now with the drop, this is pretty flat, or even somewhat, slightly increasing but more or less outpaced by the amount of collateral being added.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003436></a><a href=#003436>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h34m36s">00:34:36</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So this is a behavior that I think we now pretty consistently say is expected. So essentially, as the ETH price takes a hit, people will stop pulling collateral out and they'll actually start putting some more in. And as the ETH price rises, and people are feeling bullish, they'll feel more comfortable pulling collateral out. So this is pretty well explained phenomena at this point. What's been happening in terms of debt and supply: so essentially, over time, we can have seen this consistent increase in the DAI supply, and so what you saw was essentially this draw line was growing, growing and growing and growing pretty rapidly. But the white line in terms of voluntary shuts and wipes had essentially kept pace initially and then sort of gotten outpaced by the amount of debt that was being minted, but just in the last few months, had picked up and accelerated and started to close the gap.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003547></a><a href=#003547>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h35m47s">00:35:47</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And so that's where you started to see this DAI supply start to come down. There were also some liquidations, but then we essentially see this precipice around mid-July where just you know, that draw amount is still somewhat consistently growing, slowing down a little bit, but then that wipe line is just accelerated rapidly. What's interesting is, since you know, maybe the last couple of weeks, that wipe line has also slowed down. So the supply has actually been in a relatively steady state. So even though in the in the week time frame, it does look like there's a bit more wipe than draw, in the grand scheme of things it's still pretty comparatively flat. And then we see in the longer time scale as well. So essentially, that ETH prices it takes those hits, there's some slight stepwise jumps in the amount of debt that's liquidated.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003646></a><a href=#003646>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h36m46s">00:36:46</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And so you know, you saw huge jumps at the end of 2018.

And essentially the standard deviation of that, just go back to a couple weeks ago, the standard deviation of that had sort of come down a bit.

So I'm fairly confident, whether it's correct or not, there's going to be, and I've seen this in the forums and the chats, some people pushing to lower that stability fee few again.

Although the DAI price, I would say, is also probably propped up by a little bit of purchasing behavior. This is the most likely explanation of this.

Okay, so, Early July was probably one of the more quote unquote, urgent moments of, "hey DAI is taking consistent hits. We should increase the stability fee." This was also probably prior to having some visibility on what's been going on with secondary markets.

And I think that the main concern is that DAI is trading so consistently for so long above a dollar. Because it hasn't just been seven days that this has been going on. I think it's been almost two weeks if I'm not mistaken. And so does the duration of DAI trading above the peg, at even if it's just a cent, or a cent and a half or something, does that warrant a bigger move down?

The question really becomes, if we can quantify it, and if it's growing, and if demand is in the driver's seat, right now, we're just on a unicycle, and we have pushed on one side, now we've passed over an equilibrium, and now we have to accelerate to catch ourselves.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004625></a><a href=#004625>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqjux5ipA8&t=00h46m25s">00:46:25</a></td> <td>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td>That's the challenge we have in single collateral.

The other thing, addressing, half a percent versus 2%, et cetera. You've heard me many, many times advocate for these smaller percentage changes relatively regularly, rather than sudden 2% changes infrequently. So, if you were to draw like a two by two grid, in terms of frequency and severity of changes, I do think that the smaller frequent changes is going to yield superior results than large, infrequent changes. Which is more or less how things have been going, I mean, I'm calling 2%. large. And again, that's a discussion point. But yes, I will advocate for the smaller changes, because the bigger the change, the greater the likelihood that you're going to over or under shoot. That's a process management principle point.

I mean, I just, I'm a absolute advocate in violent execution, and not waiting for it to be perfect. If we end up with perfect consensus, and there really isn't a reason to have a vote in the first place.

For this to work it needs to it this kind of a process is ripe for exploitation. So somebody can come along and have all the best intentions. But once they have 50,000 Maker under their belts, they might realize some of the darker natures have come to the fore, or somebody could just be a huge scam artist. We need to make sure that people that are staking their Maker and allocating voting rights to somebody else or doing it in a way that's safe and recoverable and all the rest.

Because reading through those mandate threads, you kind of have to do a sentiment analysis with like, was there any major flaws determined in this mandate? Are people generally accepting of these things? And the problem is, there's no algorithms for that. So somebody has to make a decision. And making that decision is risky, because human frailties come into play. But the short answer is, I have no idea.
