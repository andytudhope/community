Brown</td> <td align=left>Hello everyone. Welcome to the April 18<sup>th</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. This is our thirty first call, so congratulations to everyone for surviving this long, it's a bit of a milestone, it's an achievement in my books. It's not easy to keep momentum up on these things so I'm very encouraged to see the number of people that are continuing to join these calls and engage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000027>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h00m27s">00:00:27</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>It's ... What's happening here is interesting, it's unique and we're all on the forefront of this very new and unusual wave of online or [inaudible 00:00:38] governance and so thanks again for joining. Keep the preamble light, we are desperately interested in getting as much engagement as we possibly can from this audience today, so if you have a question, please type it in the chat on the side. We'll ask it if you don't have access to a microphone, if you do have access to a microphone please jump in at any time and ask your questions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000103>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h01m03s">00:01:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Today's meeting agenda looks like this: we'll have a brief thought of the week from Steven, I'm going to talk about some of the issues that arise from the way that we have polling and governance, or voting set up and then we'll hear from two analysts which Cyrus will introduce us to at the risk part of the call. I think that's it from me Steven, I'm gonna hand it off to you.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000128>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h01m28s">00:01:28</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>No, thanks man. Well, to reiterate what you're saying and like ... firstly, hello everybody and thank you for actually participating on these calls. I must admit that last week, we may have had a record turnout, and I'm certainly hoping we can take that momentum forward because the contributions that are coming in, the work that's getting done, the ability to facilitate it's just improving from week to week, so and you know, just on that basis, you know, thank you very much. But, you know, one thing I like to do is just reiterate every single week exactly what the themes are that we cover. I think it's crucial to know these themes because it defines very clearly the spectrum of the risk that is considered in the system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000210>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h02m10s">00:02:10</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>I mean, the first theme, the one that we've been, you know, really centering in these discussions is about the demand and supply and balance or, another way of looking at it is the demand and supply equilibrium. The second, clearly covers the collateral types that we will start presenting in the future, the collateral portfolio as a whole, the parameters to those collateral types and parameters ... and portfolio and the adjustments to those as well. I know that was a bit of a mouth full, but really it's all about collateral types. And then, the last theme that we'd like to cover in these calls are the exogenous risks to the system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000245>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h02m45s">00:02:45</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>So, again, as you know, Rich pointed out, we are probably going to be tackling the demand and supply imbalance and we're probably touch lightly on the governance process, highlighting a few of the issues, we need to keep in mind when voting and I'm kind of looking forward to hearing from the two community members that will contribute ... that have been contributing to the risk working group. Really great examples of how contributions in the background are starting to, you know, show real merit and gives us a good sense of how to keep the momentum going. But, again, you know, keep in mind this is decentralized scientific governance and ultimately, what is considered here is being facilitated by the foundation in this very short hour, with the objective of helping MKR governance to make decisions and needs. And, again, and I will always keep reminding everyone that this is a continuous function, governance is a continuous action, so please be involved as much as possible.

We've seen some interesting behaviors arise from those mechanisms, we've iterated a bit over the last couple of weeks, where it became apparent that we really needed to tighten up the cadence of how we initiate a poll, how we discuss those results and how we initiate a vote and most importantly, how quickly we can encapsulate that entire process. The idea is that we wrap that up in a seven day period, that allows the community to have enough agility to respond to market pressures and adjust to the peg as they see fit. It also allows the organization enough breathing room to handle the mechanics in the backhand and the intendant steps that it takes to actually get that ... those proposals showing up in the portal, which are ... I won't bore you with it, but are not inconsequential.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000529>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h05m29s">00:05:29</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Here's where that leaves us though, so we have this cadence on paper it looks really good, when put into practice, like anything in the world of software, you start identifying edge case and one of those edge cases and one of the those edge cases is what I want to talk about today because it, internally has spawned a fantastic number of conversations and also in the rocket chat and in the sub Reddit of potential solutions and so we no end of solutions for this problem but we don't know which one is the best one. So, that was a mysterious little preamble. I'm going to provide some detailed context and, or order to do that I am literally just going to read what I wrote, what I posted in the sub Reddit, so if I sound stilted and or mechanical for a while it's because I'm literally just reading things out loud.

On Thursday, we get together and talk about how the poll went and discuss other issues. On Friday, we throw up an executive vote, which presents a new picture, a new state of the system that can be chosen by voters that contains the winning poll option. So, basically in the mall that we've been playing with so far it's whatever number had the most signal from the poll, it was the number shows up for the stability fee and the executive vote and then we all determine whether we want to support this new picture of the system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000705>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h07m05s">00:07:05</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>This is a fairly clean way of doing things and ... but it carries some assumptions with at and we might be spoiled with the way that this process has worked in the past because what has happened up until just very recently is there's been a tremendous amount of voter engagements, a great deal of interest, we present this executive votes ...</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000726>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h07m26s">00:07:26</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Actually, back up a second, we have the poll and up until this week there's been a very clear signal about which one of these poll options were most enticing to the community, which, you know, makes us all have a great deal of confidence in the way the system is behaving and then we take that clearly winning poll option or we put it into an executive vote. And, in the past, we've also had the satisfaction of seeing that executive vote be ratified within ten to twelve hours, same day basically, tremendous amount of MKR moves from the old state of the system into the new state. That creates a great deal of clarity and then that free us up to have a bit of a weekend before we begin this process over again following Monday.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000808>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h08m08s">00:08:08</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>The problem that we have discovered though, is that we're not always ... we can't live in a world where we expect that type of clarity.

"Two percent" is twenty three percent of the turnout. "Raise it by three percent" is thirty eight. "Raise it by four" is eighteen. So, that's number a number soup but there's no clear, clear winner in the poll that we have this week.

But, that's a largely uncoordinated and organic series of capitulations and negotiations that need to happen offline, so I can't really speculate too much on what that might look like. But, to get in ... or to pick up the thread though, so we have a situation we have sort of an ambiguous poll and that creates some issues where we need to decide, well, if we have four options in poll with five options and only one of them is in the lead by whatever, ten percent, is that really a situation where we need to through the rigmarole of having an executive vote, so I'm gonna leave that question open for now and I'm gonna go back to another problem that we saw in the system over the weekend.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001036>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h10m36s">00:10:36</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>And, that's the problem where we had ... last week we had the poll, it was fairly clear which one of the options the community wanted the most.

And, on Saturday, nobody ... there was no clear winner as well and on Sunday, there was no clear winner as well and that was probably because I needed to tee up the next poll for the system on Sunday and that made me ask a very uncomfortable question.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001114>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h11m14s">00:11:14</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So, if there's a poll coming on Sunday ... or Monday that is asking for which of these range of options do we want to see.

And then we have state number three which is there is actually a disagreement where there's a significant number of voters who have no intention of moving into the new picture of the system, they're happy where things were and they're not going to move their MKR. That creates ambiguity because that means that we don't know which state of the system we're polling for.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001320>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h13m20s">00:13:20</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>We could set out a poll and then people could change their minds and then start moving into a new state of the system and then ... mid poll.

Or, if the ... well, I guess that's enough of an example there, because of the sands are constantly shifting underneath, the polling system, even relative and absolute values have a potential for being signaled for but no longer appropriate and then we'd have to be in this position where we are presenting executive votes for a system that no longer exists or we're in a situation where we're vetoing polls because they no longer make sense and that's a risky situation to be in, I think.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001617>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h16m17s">00:16:17</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Does that make sense Matthew, or have I failed to understand your suggestion?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001621>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h16m21s">00:16:21</a></td> <td align=left>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td align=left>No, I mean that's it.

So, if we're at eleven and a half now, the vote maybe should have minus two, minus one, zero, one and two. And that's just the executive vote, and it should be a continuous role, but you're really not voting for the change. We really, in my view, should really be voting for what we think the actual end stability fee would be. We logically should know what the state was beforehand and so it's very similar to these telegram polls that they run, where you can retract your vote and cast a different changing vote and it's just a live continually voting system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001715>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h17m15s">00:17:15</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Yeah, so that's good because that turns over a rock that I've been considering as well because we have this polling system, and I think that ... and I could be completely wrong and if somebody has deeper insight, please stop me before it's too late, but the polling system was initially designed to gather signals around things that don't actually result in a state change. So, the MakerDAO principles, or we should do X, Y and Z in the real world or something. The executive votes primarily are to execute an new state of the system and so one of the questions I've been asking myself is is it not the correct place to be polling for a range of options, when instead, possibly, there should be a range of the options that are simply placed into the executive voting system and that's simply it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001805>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h18m05s">00:18:05</a></td> <td align=left>Chris Padovano</td> <td align=left>Wait, I have a technical question.

But, perhaps people that are willing to vote in a poll are not willing to vote in an executive. So, we might be seeing a disconnect between signals and what large holders actually are hoping to see. It could be vice versa, large holders have to deal with custodians, they have a lot of multi sigs and they have to dig things out of safes in order to access to the ledgers. So, maybe they're willing to go through those hoops in order for an executive, but they're not willing to go through that hoop just to signal some information on a poll.

So, we have an executive on Friday and then the following Monday we kick off another poll, so the intervening weekend, is that enough time for the market to react, is that enough time for people to understand the new state of the system, is there any breathing room here, you know. And is it just a fantastically inconvenient time for people to be moving their tokens out of cold storage, something we need to think about.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002138>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h21m38s">00:21:38</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>And this is one of the puzzlers for me I think is, how do we know whether a new picture of the system, a new vote, has been placed into the portal has failed or not, or has a lack of support? We have an existing picture of the system, we've put in an executive and after two days, three days, five days, it doesn't reach a majority, does that mean we can all assume that this is a weak proposal and is there any utility in even having it in there. So, there's been a lot of options thrown around where we can potentially start thinking about thresholding, this amount of MKR needs to vote in order to have an executive. This executive needs to have enough MKR in it to be valid and if after x number of days there's not ... there's like five percent of MKR in the new executive after five days, maybe it just gets cleaned out and goes back into the old executive picture and we clean up the system that way.

Yeah, so just as far as quick introductions I'm not sure if I've ever introduced myself properly on the call but I am computer science and biology by education, worked in, you know, the academic space in a lot of hard science research fields and then ... since then, got involved with a few tech startups, particularly a health insurance startup that I worked at for a couple of years where we did a lot of kind of analytics and risk-modeling and financial modeling. Since then, moved onto a crypto focused research firm last year and then just in the past month or so, I've kind of broken off and kind of started doing consulting on my own and publishing, you know, graphs and tweets and posts a little bit more publicly. Just kind of trying to get a little insight and analysis out there and into the space and into community calls like this, so we can help inform what's going on.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002552>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h25m52s">00:25:52</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>Now, on the data side, let me go ahead and share my screen here. Okay. You can see these graphs. So, here was the price peg, so essentially the previous stability fee increase was around March 22<sup>nd</sup> and the most recent one was April 14<sup>th</sup>, so what we saw was basically the price peg had been kind of declining for a while and I think that rate of decline had kind of slowed or come to a head with a bit of a valley just before the most recent increase. But, that was following a huge spike in transaction volume. What we saw in the last few days since the increase was a drop in that transaction value but the ... again we should discount it because it's a lighter volume but there price peg, starting to recover a little bit from that sort of ninety five ish, ninety six ish low to about ninety seven to most recently and then I think Lev was showing similar numbers, on stablecoin.science.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002720>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h27m20s">00:27:20</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, this was just sort of the same thing in the context of what's been going on with ETH price, so it is interesting to kind of compare. With the previous increase, we were dealing with an ecosystem were ETH price was rising. With the most recent increase we have sort of seen a few points dip in the ETH price. Now, I think the overall view is sort of lukewarm in the sense that it looks like we're starting to get a little bit more healthy stability back into the system, but again, with lower trading volumes and with ETH price having come down in the last few days, we should probably discount like how much we can attribute that purely to the stability fee increase versus other independent variables outside of the Maker ecosystem.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002810>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h28m10s">00:28:10</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, and just like ... I think it's a continued trend that's been observed, a bit of an inverse relationship in terms of what's going in with ETH and what happens with DAI. On the supply side, so, I think positive again, indicator, but wanna keep things tempered is since the few days before the most recent stability fee increase, there was a bit of a ramp up in the outstanding supply. But, I think that tends to happen just before an increase and then after that increase that supply has come down a bit, mainly I think due to the large volume of MKR get .. of DAI getting wiped on April 15<sup>th</sup>, which was the day after the increase. I'd also ... a separate thing that is not shown here that I kind of tweeted out, just following a few transactions, there were a few big transactions where people were borrowing DAI on secondary platforms like Compound and Dharma and then going ahead and using that to pay down their CDPs, which I think was kind of the behavior that we try to incentivize with increasing the stability fee, is to just kind of make it a little bit more expensive so that people consider wiping down their debt. And they are in, what I'm seeing, taking advantage of some of those secondary platforms as a lever, or an alternative platform to obtaining DAI.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#002940>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h29m40s">00:29:40</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Vishesh, can I ask you a quick question?

I think we're sort of at that stage where we're seeing some motifs, some patterns, that, you know, we can maybe start to make some very light predictions on and then kind of test the quality of those trends by how well they hold up to what we see in the next couple of iterations I would say. But, I think we certainly probably need at least a few more weeks before we can start to say anything for sure, because I think the real trick is we want to see a variety of independent environmental conditions, right.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003052>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h30m52s">00:30:52</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So we wanna see stable ETH price, we wanna see volatile ETH price, rising, falling, a lot of different types of conditions, both when we keep the stability fee steady, when we increase it, and we essentially wanna be able to control for as many different variables as possible.

So, just as mentioned before, transaction volume, big spikes just post the previous increase and then this was actually something that we had mentioned last week, was that transaction volume was healthy. It has been dropping since then, but I think that is a little bit natural in terms of what's been going on in terms of the outstanding supply. I think it's primarily been people wiping down debt which is the healthy behavior that we're looking for.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003225>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h32m25s">00:32:25</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, what was interesting with the secondary lending platform rates was in the past, it had kind of been cheaper to get DAI from Maker. More recently, it's been cheaper to get ... Oh, sorry, it had been cheaper to get DAI from Maker, but now that we've made that a little more expensive, I think what we've seen is fewer people taking their DAI, getting it from Maker and supplying it on these secondary lending platforms. But, I think a healthy, semi-sustained level of people when they're in a crunch, going to those platforms and getting DAI and using it to wipe down their debts.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003309>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h33m09s">00:33:09</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, I think the role of these secondary lending platforms has shifted is what I'm saying and I think it's shifted a little bit more to what it's supposed to be used for, which is kind of a last resort for getting ... and I know there's been a discussion about whether Maker should be the lender of last resort or not, but I think people have kind of been going to theses secondary lending platforms recently only when they really need to. Whereas, in the past, there's been a ton of activity of people just drawing out DAI willy nilly and then supply it on these platforms to try and get some kind of yield because it was really cheap to do so.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003347>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h33m47s">00:33:47</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, I think this is a healthier shift, but there's probably a lot of debate about that. So, in terms of the volume, as I had mentioned last week there had been this kind of continual uptick of the supply and borrow volume on these platforms, slight dip just post the stability fee increase in terms of the amount being supplied. That has recovered a little bit, I think that was a lot of people essentially trying to reclaim access to some of their DAI to try and wipe down debts.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003423>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h34m23s">00:34:23</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>One new addition, which ... apologies, it does seem a little bit messy, but when I zoom in it'll be a little bit cleaner. This is something that was discussed a little bit last week that I wanted to just show, to answer a couple of questions. The questions that we've gotten were like when people are drawing out DAI, are ... is it new CDPs that are drawing out DAI, or is it existing CDPs that are kinda levering up their amount of debt?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003452>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h34m52s">00:34:52</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>And so, what I've just kind of done was looked at, okay, at a daily level how much of the DAI being drawn is being drawn with CDPs that were created, let's say, within twenty four hours, or CDPs that had already been existing, you know, more than twenty four hours ago. And so, essentially, what we see is ... and then I did just the nine day simple moving average and then graphed the ratio of the two as well. So, what we've seen which is kind of interesting is since just before the last stability fee increase, more draws on new CDPs and then that kind of falls off. And, then, just leading up to the next increase more draws on new CDPs.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003539>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h35m39s">00:35:39</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, and this kind of is I think an indirect indicator of something else that I wanted to show, but will likely have to show next week, which is kind of the overall age of this debt and I think what this speaks to me is a little bit more circulation in debt being drawn and wiped down, which is, to me, healthier behavior in terms of people not sitting with so much stale, outstanding DAI, paying down some of those debts and then having some new people come in and draw out DAI when they need a loan.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003613>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h36m13s">00:36:13</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, I think this is a potentially healthy indicator, but also, given what's been going on with ETH price, I always wanna kind of qualify, because when ETH price is going up, we tend to see people want to lever hard on DAI and then ... lever hard on ETH and use DAI as a pathway for doing so. And then when that ETH price starts to fall a little bit, we do tend to see ... we did see some liquidations as well, a little light compared to in the past obviously, because it was a very small drop in price. But, in the past month or so we have not really seen very many liquidations. So, again, that drop in ETH price does tend to be a healthy moving the sludge through the pipelines kind of factor for Maker, in my opinion. Sorry, i don't wanna take up too much time. So, I think that was the gist of what I wanted to show today.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003707>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h37m07s">00:37:07</a></td> <td align=left>Alex Evans</td> <td align=left>Actually, it's up to you.

No, it is, you're paying ... your debt is lower than your collateral by value so one of them is ... maybe you don't need a lower interest rate, but if there's more of it and so potentially it could even be higher, depending on what the rates are are, I don't know what the supply rate is for ETH or whatever equivalent on Compound right now. Like, yeah, I would also be curious right now that we've seen a lot of Dharma and potentially looking at those rates here more seriously as a thing. Though, in the past, we have discussed the issue of subsidy and looking at other secondary lending platforms that are now getting some volume and looking at data from those.

So, we can see here that twenty ... two hundred fifty largest CDPs, they already represent ninety percent of whole debt. Nevertheless, for the research we used a thousand CDPs, the whole history of them which corresponds to ninety eight percent of whole debt. Here we can see historical data, but obviously I'm not going to go through the variables here.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004229>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h42m29s">00:42:29</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>So, this is one the first interesting things. We focus on last 10 days because there was a lot of wipe activity in this period. This graph is pretty much similar what we use to look at mkr.tools, but I converted everything to DAI so it's easier to compare. As expected, there was a lot of lock and draw activity in the first half of the period, when ETH price was rising and there was a lot of free and wipe activity in the second half of the period when ETH was falling and also stability fee was announced to get increased at that point.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004310>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h43m10s">00:43:10</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>What we wanted to do next ... Sorry. Yeah, what we wanted to do next is to see how much of this activity, so this, our total DAI numbers, values, for each type of event, so lock, draw and wipe and we wanted to see how much of this activity is presented by top single events. So, to see just like the maximum wipe on particular day, how much of total wipe on that day this will present that. And, interestingly, it represented about third of the activity and it's only one event.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004351>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h43m51s">00:43:51</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>So, we also looked at top five events for each day, again, for every event state and averages are pretty high. You could say like five top event represent three quarters, at least three quarters of all activity on that day. And for specifically, for wipes which were pretty high on those days, on the second period, yeah, these top five events represented like three quarters. But, these five events are not necessarily from five different CDPs, so here specifically, this were only two CDPs. So, I think it's ... this huge concentration of activity per CDP is something that's probably going away with time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004441>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h44m41s">00:44:41</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>But, on the other hand, it's kind of a good news from research perspective because it's easier to analyze if wipes actually affected the peg because we make more detailed on chain analysis of these CDPs and look if they really behave as it was intended by policy setting. So, this was exactly what we wanted to do next, perform some kind of on chain analysis or to see if these CDPs on this particular day, if they actually freed ETH from collateral, used it to buy DAI on the market and actually helped to restore the peg because this was the point of increasing the stability fee, right. So, usually ... The usual pattern you can see on chain when people ... when CDPs build leverage, they make these iterations. They draw DAI and then they convert it to ETH and then they lock ETH and they make bunch of iterations and they built leverage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004539>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h45m39s">00:45:39</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>So, we actually wanted to see if, when there were wipes if we could see similar pattern occurring and if people actually bought DAI on the market and if this actually helped restore the peg and we specifically focused on just two days and this were 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of April because you could see a lot of wipes here. And, also, on this two days we could see that DAI price increased, so I was hoping that I would be able to connect wipes and people actually buying DAI back to repay the debt with this increase of DAI price and higher volume. And it wasn't necessarily the case, so, let me show you this. So, these are two CDPs on those two days. Just a second. So, on those two days there was four million of DAI being repaid, there was four million of wipes and four million point four of ETH in dollar value being created. And, eighty percent, up to eighty six were just from these two CDPs. So, you just look at on chain of these CDPs and see how they behave.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004701>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h47m01s">00:47:01</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>So, the first CDP we found out that it was actually free from the collateral and it was used to buy DAI, but this CDP used HitBTC to do that, which was interesting to me. So, he actually deposited like in many chance ETH to HitBTC converted it to DAI and repaid his debt. Now, why did you do that? Obviously because of higher stability fee and also because ETH price was falling at that point, I wouldn't say his collateralization ratio was low, that he needed to do this.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004746>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h47m46s">00:47:46</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>So, I guess that is the good news. He actually did it, but perhaps not so good thing is that he actually used HitBTC, so, that's why we can't fully see this straight here. If we were including this data, HitBTC, obviously on this two days, price of DAI should be a bit higher so it would look much better to state in other words. And, also, one interesting fact, I was actually amazed HitBTC has ten million of DAI deposited there. So, obviously some people are actually using HitBTC to trade DAI it's ... I am not sure, there are rumors about wash-trading but just one interesting thing about it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004832>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h48m32s">00:48:32</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>The other thing is the second CDP, so we believe wipes of this CDP were associated with low collateralization ratio because it almost fell to one hundred sixty and I guess the owner needed to lower his leverage and he actually made this iterations that we usually see when people build up leverage and followed it again on chain. Why did he ... how did he perform the ... how did he bought DAI and we couldn't actually see any of the major venues, be it the decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges. We could see where the funds came from, but we're not sure, was it ... It could be that there was OTC desk in the middle, it could be that were some spare DAI somewhere although I don't believe it. Or, it could be that it was borrowed on some secondary lending platforms and I'm pretty ... really not sure, it's hard to say. But, we are really certain that none of these wipes on these two days where we thought, okay, this is helping with the peg. It didn't actually, this trades that we see here, I guess they were mostly associated with some guys going, hedging their positions and buying DAI because ETH was falling at that point. I guess it's related with that.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005002>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h50m02s">00:50:02</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>So, that I would say is the main conclusion about it. Just the last thing and then I've finished. This is something that we played a bit recently. It doesn't have to do with what I just presented. It's just we tried to estimate the leverage of CDPs, I think that's one metric that I'm kind of missing is basically something you can adjust from collateralization ratio, but what I was curious about was how much people actually lock their own money inside versus how much of the collateral they have, right, and collateral is of course made by borrowing. So, that's the point of leverage long. And this number is aggregated number for thousand CDPs and I was ... I thought it was going to be higher but it's not really, it's one point four six and I think it's a good metric to have because if you can monitor it through time, you can assess some kind of risk position of CDP holders, how they behave two time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#005109>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=0h51m09s">00:51:09</a></td> <td align=left>Primoz Kordez</td> <td align=left>And that's basically all from my end.

So, my first takeaway, or my immediate takeaway from this was that, you know, earlier this week when we saw like three, four million DAI reduced, you know wasn't ... it was just from literally just a couple people they were just going to HitBTC and to me that doesn't really seem like the kind of response we're hoping for. Does anybody else agree?

Like, let's assume we were at a dollar right now, and then we were to see a, you know, a sharp ETH move, you know, how can we ... I mean we would have to create a model that would, you know, input ... so, I mean but this ... isn't this just going back to just inputting the ETH prices as a factor into determining what the stability fee and everything should be.

I mean right now it's kind of somewhat tapered out around two point one million and it hasn't really launched higher. So, extract what you want from that. Maybe there are ninety eight million ETH holders that don't feel comfortable locking their ETH in a DAO, but if you end up having significantly more collateral accessible but just not locked in, doesn't that screw with the numbers?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010430>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=1h04m30s">01:04:30</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So, one ... I think that that's broadly the right instinct Matthew. One thing that I would say is volatility versus just absolute level is an important thing. So, what I think is a big driver of collateralization ratio is yes, the absolute ETH price, but also the volatility of ETH and so essentially, when we see ETH being very volatile, we tend to see a corresponding relative increase in collateralization ratio. When we see ETH prices are high, just based on simple math, we see an absolute increase in collateralization ratio and one of the different [crosstalk 01:05:13] -</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#010513>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOReXqC35Y&t=1h05m13s">01:05:13</a></td> <td align=left>Michael Dunworth</td> <td align=left>Yeah, and that's because the underlying asset hasn't changed as aggressively so if you've got a one or two percent, you know, deposit or withdraw into the PETH pool, that's the system effectively and if that's not changing and that's constant as like a count of assets in the pool, then ETH can run up a thousand percent and the pool is gonna keep blowing up exactly in line with the price. But, if the deposits of ETH are running parallel, so the actual count, if it goes up a thousand percent or ... yeah, it goes up a thousand percent in price, then, if you have a thousand percent increase in deposits into the PETH pool then they should be almost one to one.

Then we start ramping up some of the options that I wanna keep on exploring in the MKRgov link, do we have thresholding? So, for the poll, that is twenty percent of all maker need to show up before that poll is valid or does one of the poll options need to be twenty five percent higher than the second best option?

It seems like that could potentially be an option as well, but I think that the course is set now and changing that would sort of create a crisis of confidence in the way that we have governance at MakerDAO, to not do it because we don't like it.
