We always have a lot to go over, but ... Welcome everybody, to the February 21<sup>st</sup> edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting, with Steven Becker, Rune Christensen, and an array of industry luminaries. Every meeting, I kick off with the same brief speech, but I'm gonna keep on doing it because it's super important to me. We love debates, we love questions, and we love interacting with people. We have things to learn, and we have things to teach as well, so let's get this circle of sharing going.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0033>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=33">00:33</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>If anybody has any questions, any comments, any thoughts, please feel free to type those in the chat in the side, if you don't have access to a microphone. If you do have a microphone, please feel free to jump in whenever you need to and ask questions. We're here to talk, and some of the questions we get are amazing. It's a highlight of my calls. I think I'm gonna hand that over to you directly, Steven and let you set the agenda for us.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0102>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=1m2s">01:02</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Okay, so, what I'd like to do today, is talk firstly about two things. Number one, the metrics we are looking at right now, that may inform us to consider another change in the Stability Fee. I don't think we've had a whole lot of time to go by, in order to access if the first raise was impactful. But, we are certainly cognizant of it, and we need to be very much aware of where we are right now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0136>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=1m36s">01:36</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Then, the second aspect is, and I was asked this as well, is let's revisit the whole idea of how to be a risk team. We can go back and say, "Well, we don't have the formal tools arranged, but we can at least use this particular space to discuss elements about becoming a risk team, how you contribute, and what you need to basically consider. Thirdly, I would also like to maybe address some of the questions, or apparently many considerations, that have been put towards us. I think Richard's got a few of them that we can actually look at.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0222>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=2m22s">02:22</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>To jump off on the Stability Fee, right now, the long and short of it is, we didn't see too much of an effect on the inventory levels, but we have seen a kind of a kick up in the ETH price, and we're trying to figure out if there's some sort of determination between that happening, and the fact that we've got a large provision of DAI that hasn't decreased at the moment. Second to that, and this is what I'd like to put to the folks in this call ... Since the Stability Fee raised, do you think there has been an effect on the exchange rates on these sort of collective or aggregate idea that the DAI exchange has gone to, or has settled around one?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0314>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=3m14s">03:14</a></td> <td align=left>Joe Quintillian</td> <td align=left>I would say it's a small effect. Sorry, Steven, but I think it wasn't <span><span class=MathJax_Preview>this is Joe Q</span><script type=math/tex>this is Joe Q</script></span>. I don't think there's been that much of an effect, just a little bit. That's about it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#0326>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=3m26s">03:26</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>My impression is, actually things have gotten worse now. We're seeing multiple Reddit posts, with people just complaining and being like, "DAI's so weak," and this kinda stuff. I think we should just try to get a consensus today to continue with the 0.5 percent raises. Just in general, there are some people out there saying, "We need to go to 4 percent," or, "We need to go to 10 percent," and so on. I actually have that ... of course it's really hard to say in advance, but I think there's a good chance that we are quite unbalanced considering that ETH is looking four ways in a lot of stuff.

The size of the dot is proportional to the volume of the trade. All these trades were gathered from a couple of Dexes. If you're wondering which ones, it's the Dexes where most DAI volume happens.

One thing, is as Rune was pointing out, market sentiment and credit demand is very sensitive to what's going on in the market. Possibly much more so than something small like a Stability Fee move. Indeed, what we've seen in the past month, is possibly increased foolishness around ET/ USD, and not that many downward moves. I think today was pretty much an exception, but we saw remarkably few liquidations over this time, which also means fewer people who were forced to cover their positions preemptively. That's usually a source of DAI demand. Once in a while, someone decides that they got two others, but it's unlikely that that would have happened in the past month or so because of the relative scarcity of those downward moves.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1158>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=11m58s">11:58</a></td> <td align=left>Lev Livnev</td> <td align=left>Another thing that I wanna point out, and this has never been brought up in these calls as far as I remember, but what's going on in the rest of DeFi, is I think pretty relevant. Right now, and I'm not an expert on how stuff like Compound works, but if you go on the Compound homepage, you'll see that they're offering 2.25 interest for lending your DAI. This rate, which I to be honest, don't even know where it comes from, where it's set, or who's paying it, clearly must have some effect on the rates that you can get ... sorry, on the demand for CDPs. One obvious reason, is that right now, it's a viable strategy to open a CDP and borrow DAI from it at one percent, and then lend it into Compound for 2.25 percent.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1242>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=12m42s">12:42</a></td> <td align=left>Lev Livnev</td> <td align=left>I'm not actually commenting on whether that's a good strategy, but presumably someone could be doing this, and if you imagine that Compound went and doubled their rate, then this strategy becomes twice as appealing. So, clearly more people are gonna do it, if provided someone was gonna do it in the first place. Then, likewise, if it goes down, so those rates actually have an effect on DAI supply and demand as well. There's these very clear kind of exogenous things going on, but they're still in DeFi, that are worth paying attention to. In fact, I think the DAI rate on Compound was much higher. Earlier, I remember seeing it at something like 6 or 8 percent just a couple weeks ago. I think that's just-</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1322>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=13m22s">13:22</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>The part about the conversation that's becoming more popular in the DeFi space, the interesting shift from using ETH as sort of a staking or collateralization method in order to acquire DAI, but there's this aftermarket of lending organizations that want a stable coin, in order to provide collateral as well. So, we're actually feeding into Compound. We're feeding into Nuo. We're feeding into Uniswap as well, so one of the major drivers for large amounts of DAI inventory, seems to be people lending from other platforms.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#1400>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=14m0s">14:00</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>I saw that [Vishes 00:14:01] also posted some cool stuff.

There's market forces we don't quite understand. There's crypto courses that nobody understands, but should we figure out every two weeks, we're going to make a change until we see something that's a satisfactory result? Maybe another 1.5, and if that doesn't change, move the needle, then we would go to one. Is there a standard for this stuff? Is exponential increase over steps, or do we do linear?

It's generally linear, because you've gotta think about the fact that if you started at 0.5, and you increase by 0.5, it's a 100 percent increase. Then, if you increased by 0.5 again, it's a 33 percent increase. If you're talking about an impactful increase, you gotta keep a consistent percentage, so we might have to consider increasing by more than 50 basis points. That's one thing we need to put on the table for next time, not now, because we're going against what we initially agreed upon. But, outside one thing that Lev brought up, and I completely agree with this, outside of the demand function, which is something that we have to constantly be working on, is the consideration of the DeFi space, and actually use the DeFi space to our advantage in order to manage the extreme rate of corporate leak.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2153>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=21m53s">21:53</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>That needs to be considered, and to the extent that we need to consider it, I think it's open to everyone to suggest. But, further to that, I think we need to agree right now that if we don't see an impact from the increase in Stability Fee that we moved two weeks ago, we need to firmly agree what could be other considerations. For instance, the increase in ETH, could have just promoted people to draw out more DAI. That is a factor that is confounding to the Stability Fee. Considering we're sort of bootstrapping this, we then need to be very pragmatic in terms of how these variables ... very much like the DeFi space that we're in, will contribute to the impact in the DAI exchange rate. That is the pragmatic discussion we need to have now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2254>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=22m54s">22:54</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Now, I think we need to use the Stability Fee, and increase it until we find a point where it does have an impact, but it does so exclusively and not muddled up with any other confounding variables, so-</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2307>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=23m07s">23:07</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Are you saying that we ...

The one critical thing, the one foundational piece that you have to have, is trying to understand what the demand function is and improving it. So, what are the used cases? Where can you apply it appropriately? How do you spare that? and so on and so forth. Very much like the core community development that's focused on DAI demand development.

What we're dealing with, is the Stability Fee that tries to disincentivize people through the idea of costs.

This is, again, outside of the demand function, because if the demand function ... not if, when the demand function kicks in, then that is gonna become your pragmatic point of reference. That has to be then, really the full extent of the economy that we need to deal with, 'cause right now, with this bootstrapping, we have to be very realistic with what we can do in the space that we have. So yes, I get the Stability Fee's not working. There's two weeks worth of data, so it's statistically speaking, not really impactful, not really telling.

The thing is, what we're doing right now is emulating the DAI Savings rate adjustment process. We're not following the long-run risk governance.

Let's make sure this is not taking as a precedent for how things should be done in the long-run, 'cause really this is kind of like a mix of different things altogether. So, like Steven is saying, what we're doing now, is actually an executive vote in the system, which is not something we'd really wanna do in this fashion in the long run. Doing a governance poll, is also not appropriate because this is not a decision that's meant to be a big large community thing ... like really bulky, unwieldy thing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2900>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=29m0s">29:00</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>Stability Fee changes will have to happen, or rather, Savings rate changes will have to happen very often, basically all the time in response to market dynamics. But, one thing I think is necessary no matter what, is that we at least do a ceremonial little pause to see if there's anyone who wants to basically argue for the opposing viewpoints. Then, we have a risk team. Steven will sign off on the fact that we have followed the process. Then, we can go out and do this, and present this to the whole voter community, and get them to see if they will support it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#2945>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=29m45s">29:45</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>Well this bit, does anyone disagree with that construct?

If there's no one here that disagrees with this construct, then I reckon we have a decent enough sample to justify the fact that we can use this process for these kind of adjustments.

Once again, we have no data against the 0.5 percent raise. I think we can do it. Now, let's have a little pause for 10 seconds and see if anyone wants to present data or arguments against the Stability Fee raise.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#3136>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=31m36s">31:36</a></td> <td align=left>Chris Burniske</td> <td align=left>I don't have anything against the raise.

David [Perry 00:31:46] just posted something to this end as well, and I don't have the expertise to say whether it should be 50 or a 100. I think I'm more concerned with making sure we appear rational, and not erratic to the community with how we decide between the 50 basis points and the 100 basis points, because Steven just gave the example of, if we raise 50 basis points right now from where we are, it's a 50 percent increase. So, that is less of an increase than the last one we went through, which was basically doubling. So, when I think about the current market dynamics, we had Ether Rally, so that makes it easier to create more DAI. And, we have a DeFi space that's showing some strong traction, which is also creating more demand for DAI. I think we have these two drivers for a DAI supply glut.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#3249>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=32m49s">32:49</a></td> <td align=left>Chris Burniske</td> <td align=left>Personally, I think once Ethereum forks ... I personally don't see ETH continuing to rally super strongly here, and so I don't think we will face that "supply glut" headwind in a really strong way in the coming few weeks. That would for me, argue for a 50 basis point increase, 'cause then it's really the DeFi demand and supply glut that we have to take into consideration.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#3319>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=33m19s">33:19</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Chris, that's a great point. So, I wanna make sure we're capturing the variables that we need to address here, so whether it's 50 or a 100, is something we need to figure out. The other thing I'd like to make sure we keep cognizant of, what's the cadence of the changes that we're prepared to make until we see a positive solution here? Does that mean that every two weeks, this sweet spot can be stretched out to four weeks to see whether things work or not? I think that cadence is gonna be determined by how quickly ... and correct me if I'm wrong here, everyone, how quickly we approach the danger zones, the debt ceiling.

I don't think we can possibly do a 1 percent increase today for instance. If we did that, there would be no kind of warning on that, and something on that, definitely would have to. There's no expectation on the cadence, so theoretically, we could do a 0.5 increase weekly, currently.

It's just more signaling thing. I do understand, at the same time. Considering that it's really a weekly basis, and we don't really have a statistical telling of the impact yet, I think we can safely say that the foundation can be built now for a further and larger increase next week.

It's actually kind of meaningless to use those relative change terms. It's kind of like saying double the temperature. Increase the temperature by 30 percent.

I just think a funny ... well fun, or whatever, data point on this whole approach, is kinda like having an arbitrary number and then making changes to that. That's how central banks do it. They always change with 0.25 percent. The thing that then determines how much of a change they do over time, is how often they do these changes.

But, at the end of the day, it might not actually be that informative, because you might find that the confounding variables while we're bootstrapping the system, might actually play a greater part. So, we could be constantly increasing the Stability Fee until it has an effect, but maybe because the confounding variables have stopped having an effect. It really is, considering what we've discussed today and the input that we've got today, is really ... I must say, it's brilliant. This is the kind of input we need on a constant basis, until such time, as we framed all of the issues we have, not only in bootstrapping to critical mass and having a robust system, but also when the system does become robust.

I don't know the technical components about how it's put in for multi collaterals ... forgive that, but if there's not a throttling method that allows that to be slowed down on the issuance path, some portion of that may turn around to be sold off into the fiat world, which makes us look and feel like it's worse, but it's just the market improving.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4210>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=42m10s">42:10</a></td> <td align=left>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td align=left>A question I have is, is there a throttling method and/or kind of a ...

I don't care, whatever it is ... a hundred K a day. It doesn't matter what collateral it's based on, to specifically cause the supply to not be ramped up, 'cause if the price of Ether tomorrow, spiked to a thousand, there will be people who will borrow against their Ethereum holdings to go pay off their house. That house is not inside the blockchain. It will make it look like the price will go craziness on the peg, 'cause I don't necessarily think people will be dumping money into DAI at that point. They will probably be taking the other direction.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4338>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=43m38s">43:38</a></td> <td align=left>Lev Livnev</td> <td align=left>Don't you think this throttle mechanism is like a sharp cliff response of the Stability Fee? Essentially, we're saying for the first hundred K of issuance today, we're gonna have the normal Stability Fee. Then, after a hundred k, our stability fee is gonna be infinite? Then, obviously that kills credit demand completely. Then, we wait until the end of the day, and then we add another hundred to the ceiling, or whatever, like you're suggesting?

I think we can all agree that no matter how bullish the market is, or how much credit demand there is, we can probably pick a Stability Fee that will be high enough to balance that against demand, like 5 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent, whatever.

That's what's called "The defense of debt ceiling." So, this idea that we never wanna leave a really big empty space of tons of unused debt ceiling. Rather, we wanna make sure that the debt ceiling, like the actual parameters that's in the live system on the blockchain ... make sure that if suddenly there's someone who wants to generate like a billion DAI, he can't actually just do that in one go, but there is actually, like you reach it or get close to it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4516>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=45m16s">45:16</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>Then, there is sort of an off chain mechanism. So, basically a risk team that then is like, "Okay, it's safe to keep going, and keep going with that," until we hit the point that's actually set by governance, which is called the "practical debt ceiling." So, there is actually a mechanism to some extent that's like this, but I think it's very important that that mechanism is only seen as to deal with absolute kind of disaster situations, like very weird edge case situations, and not really something that should ever kick in under normal circumstances. So, normally people should run into the issue that, "Oh, whoops, you can't do your whatever, like draw for some regular amount of money."</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4556>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=45m56s">45:56</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>I also think there's a lot of hypothetical scenarios that can be thought of, of weird behavior and weird situations. I think in general, we should kind of be empirical about this stuff, in the sense that we ... In the early phases of DAI, we can't actually afford that the system looks a little bit wonky, because there's a ton of like a search and demand. That kind of throws it off balance a bit, and then we figure out how to deal with that. Hopefully, we'll always end up dealing with DAI Savings Rate, and be flexible enough with using it. If not, then we would be something like, "Let's be more aggressive with how we use the Defensive Debt Ceiling," for instance.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4644>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=46m44s">46:44</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>The main thing I wanna talk about, and I also want Steven to make his point about risk team, so I'll be very quick. I think it's time that we really split up the discussion about something like the debt ceiling, and long term theoretical considerations about how we run the system and is basically looking. So, the collateral side, the supply side of things, with the more short term DAI Savings rate focused ... short term monetary policy discussions that are very actionable. Especially currently, where they're really the only ones that right now, are based around actually doing real stuff with a real system. I think basically, the easiest way to do this, would be to have a Wednesday meeting at the same time. That's the monetary policy meeting, and then the Thursday meeting like now, is then the long-term risk governance meeting.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4741>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=47m41s">47:41</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>Basically next week, we could then have the Wednesday meeting be the one where we discuss ...

A lot of the theory around this ... 'cause one of the interesting things, is that people typically think the reason why you have to increase the debt ceiling, is because supply reaches a certain level, and CDP demand reaches a certain level. What's funny is, it's actually a demand that sort of drives when you must increase the debt ceiling, and it's actually a question of when DAI demand explodes that really creates that sort of pressure to eventually ... So basically, face the fact that eventually we either have to increase the debt ceiling, or we have to shut down the system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#4855>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=48m55s">48:55</a></td> <td align=left>Rune Christensen</td> <td align=left>There's no option to keep the debt ceiling at a hundred million forever, so I think this way, we will be able to focus a lot more in these discussions.

See you next week.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#5639>#</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/KKDpN1fe0cU?t=56m39s">56:39</a></td> <td align=left>Chris Burniske</td> <td align=left>Thank you.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </article> </div> </div> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-footer-copyright> Made with <a href=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ target=_blank rel=noopener> Material for MkDocs </a> </div> <div class=md-footer-social> <a href=https://github.com/maker/community target=_blank rel=noopener title=github.com class=md-footer-social__link> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 496 512"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"/></svg> </a> <a href=https://twitter.com/MakerDAO target=_blank rel=noopener title=twitter.com class=md-footer-social__link> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M459.37 151.716c.325 4.548.325 9.097.325 13.645 0 138.72-105.583 298.558-298.558 298.558-59.452 0-114.68-17.219-161.137-47.106 8.447.974 16.568 1.299 25.34 1.299 49.055 0 94.213-16.568 130.274-44.832-46.132-.975-84.792-31.188-98.112-72.772 6.498.974 12.995 1.624 19.818 1.624 9.421 0 18.843-1.3 27.614-3.573-48.081-9.747-84.143-51.98-84.143-102.985v-1.299c13.969 7.797 30.214 12.67 47.431 13.319-28.264-18.843-46.781-51.005-46.781-87.391 0-19.492 5.197-37.36 14.294-52.954 51.655 63.675 129.3 105.258 216.365 109.807-1.624-7.797-2.599-15.918-2.599-24.04 0-57.828 46.782-104.934 104.934-104.934 30.213 0 57.502 12.67 76.67 33.137 23.715-4.548 46.456-13.32 66.599-25.34-7.798 24.366-24.366 44.833-46.132 57.827 21.117-2.273 41.584-8.122 60.426-16.243-14.292 20.791-32.161 39.308-52.628 54.253z"/></svg> </a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src=../../../../assets/javascripts/vendor.241d0c29.min.js></script> <script src=../../../../assets/javascripts/bundle.05dbdb2b.min.js></script><script id=__lang type=application/json>{"search.config.lang": "en", "clipboard.copy": "Copy to clipboard", "search.result.none": "No matching documents", "search.result.other": "# matching documents", "search.config.separator": "[\\s\\-]+", "search.result.placeholder": "Type to start searching", "search.config.pipeline": "trimmer, stopWordFilter", "clipboard.copied": "Copied to clipboard", "search.result.one": "1 matching document"}</script> <script>
