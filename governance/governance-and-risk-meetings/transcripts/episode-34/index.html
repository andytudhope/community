We have some things to go over today, some interesting developments in the world of MakerDAO. As always, we're going to have a chat.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000016>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h00m16s">00:00:16</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I'm just going to, well should I do the preambles, I'll do the preamble super fast. We're super excited to have everybody in the call, we have some deep thinkers and some people with some really great opinions and it's extremely important to me and the rest of the organization that everybody gets heard.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000032>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h00m32s">00:00:32</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>We want the additional insight, the additional color and commentary, so if you have something to say, please feel free to just jump right in and start speaking and start asking questions. If you don't have a microphone or if you're supposed to be working right now, just chat in the window and we will trawl for interesting questions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000050>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h00m50s">00:00:50</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>We're going to do something else today, maybe even formalize something today that we've been doing for a while and that's continuing the call after the top of the hour. Because there's a lot of really interesting freeform risk type questions that emerged last two or three calls and I want to keep that momentum going.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000107>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h01m07s">00:01:07</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So here's what's going to happen, Steven will give us his thoughts of the week and then I'm going to talk a bit about what's been happening in the governance world and MakerDAO in general, that affects risk and governance. Then, we'll jump into Cyrus with the risk teams and we'll see what's going on with the peg. We will have a summary from Steven and then we will stick around afterwards and just chat about money and crypto and stuff.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000133>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h01m33s">00:01:33</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>That is my preamble.

Well, over the last couple of weeks, there's obviously been a lot of news in the crypto space and obviously, MakerDAO being on the forefront as one of the main components in the crypto space, we were obviously in that line of sight as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000230>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h02m30s">00:02:30</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>And so what we basically have clearly established is the MakerDAO protocol is important in developing the crypto space and the DeFi space and understanding clearly how it is integral to it and how we need to establish a firm sense of, not only the DeFi space and our operation, because also the traditional space as well. But in that light, we need to be very cognizant of how stakeholders use the system, organizations integrate with the system and how constantly the system is always under review.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#000313>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h03m13s">00:03:13</a></td> <td align=left>Steven Becker</td> <td align=left>And during this process, you find extraordinary gems that give you a new use case you never saw before, but also at the same time, you identify issues.

That contract behaves exactly the same way as the old one did, minus some functionality that was extraneous.

If the peg is below, then the options available to people for the stability fee are in the positive integers. If the peg is above one, then we would flip that and we'd offer a poll with the range of zero to -4.

We ran into a situation where we were having trouble wrestling with the idea of what the current state of the system is or what the preferred state of the system is. We use a continuous polling mechanism and that means that there's traditionally two pictures of what MakerDAO could look like in the executive. One is the existing and/or old picture and one is the new and/or proposed picture.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001040>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h10m40s">00:10:40</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Happily in the past, we've seen sort of an overwhelming rush to the newest option that's been presented in the executive, which creates some confidence in the system and sort of lulled us into this belief that every time we have an executive, because of the weight of the poll, that signaled the will of the people. And then that got ratified.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001103>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h11m03s">00:11:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>A couple weeks ago, we ran into a situation where it didn't get ratified until late Sunday.

And just haven't gotten around to ratifying the new one.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001123>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h11m23s">00:11:23</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So crisis ambiguity. Ambiguity is fine in principle, it's not fine if we need to have a poll the next day that's based on the picture of the system that everybody seems to agree on. So there's ambiguity here that we still haven't quite dealt with and it's kind of, in over the last few governance calls, it's faded into the background because we didn't run into this issue again. People have been happy to move the majority of the stake weights into the new executive, generally on Friday. Like I said, we haven't addressed this.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001201>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h12m01s">00:12:01</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>That's a long-winded description, to create some context around where we are right now.

So that also throws another wrench into it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001258>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h12m58s">00:12:58</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>In fact, by definition, you can't ever have a defined cadence for when the governance polls will run.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001304>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h13m04s">00:13:04</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>I agree and there's definite ambiguity here and like I said, we were lulled into this kind of idea that, oh, there's a new executive, new is better than old, so therefore everybody's going to jump on new, but that's not what continuous approval voting means.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001318>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h13m18s">00:13:18</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>So this is an unsolved problem that we still need to address. There's been some ideas about how do we decouple the ranges that are in the polls from the executive altogether? So in a poll, you could just have -100 stability fee to +100 stability fee and then presumably people would just arbitrarily pick some kind of range or that range would be...</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001343>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h13m43s">00:13:43</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Anyways, I don't want to dig into all of the possible variations of that issue that we need to address.

Guidance, that the community is ahead of this curve and as the rest of the ecosystem catches up and the peg begins to stabilize, we can begin to wind these things down and this follows the model, it is better to overshoot than to undershoot.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001448>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h14m48s">00:14:48</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>And part of that cadence is, we have in the seven day cadence, we have like I said, a poll on Monday, then it lasts for three days, then we take a day off and then we have an executive on Friday. The question here is, are we losing engagement with the executive on Friday, because people have sophisticated custodial solutions, their hardware wallets are locked in a safe in their office or some filing cabinet somewhere?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001513>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h15m13s">00:15:13</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Or people just have things to do on the weekend, they don't necessarily want to be spending all their time thinking about Maker like I do.

There's a possibility that there's additional confusion created by this 0% option, because it's weird when you think about it. Presumably, if somebody votes for a 0% option, they are signaling that they think the system is fine the way it is right now and we shouldn't change it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001724>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h17m24s">00:17:24</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>If that is overwhelmingly selected at any point in the future, what we've ultimately decided though as a group is that we don't need to have an executive at all. So it's worth considering that the options that we have in these votes, in the polls, are no change, as in no executive as the first option and then the second option is 1% increase, 2% increase, 3% etc. That would eliminate the need to have these extraneous executive votes that may be weak votes, that don't necessarily reflect the will of the MKR holders.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#001803>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h18m03s">00:18:03</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>All right, that was a data dump and I'm sorry if that was a little boring.

It was just the numbers that were presented in a reddit thread, nobody questioned them, it encapsulated the range of all previous rate increases that we've considered in the past and it just stuck.

Share my screen. So just the broad-strokes to start, I think I have tried to hold a fairly conservative view up to now.

There were some sort of periods of up and down, Tether news etc, but broadly, in terms of volume weighted average, it's been holding pretty steady.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003149>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h31m49s">00:31:49</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>And then in the past week or so, I would say it's trended up a bit. And then sort of in between in the variance, it's hit the peg at certain points and even shot above it, like the day of the Tether news. So for me, what this says is at least what's been going on with the DAI supply and combined with the stability fees has had a measurable impact and it seems that DAI is at least trading close to the peg and it's unclear if we continue to increase the stability fee, if it would necessarily reach the peg. But at the very least, it's definitely hovering close to.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003235>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h32m35s">00:32:35</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So I had started to look, as I mentioned, into the DAI price and the ETH price. We've seen this relationship I think hold fairly consistent and we've mentioned this a few times, ETH price being a big driver for DAI makes sense, in the sense that what's going on with ETH drives the sentiment and desire for leverage, which is a big use case for Maker.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003302>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h33m02s">00:33:02</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>Now, one thing here is, this is just the simple moving average, one of the other components that I'd looked at was the ratio of the simple moving average to, in the short-term, to the simple moving average in the long-term. So let me just show that here.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003321>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h33m21s">00:33:21</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>And I had started to run some regressions on this, but I know I'm getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here. That had shown an even stronger relationship. The reason that this to me is an important metric, is because it starts to speak to effectively in the short term, how cheap is ETH trading to what the long-term trend is.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003342>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h33m42s">00:33:42</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>And so that makes sense in that as ETH is trading cheaper, you would expect more bullish sentiment and so more folks could be selling DAI to get leverage on ETH. What's interesting is I think this sort of relationship has held steady, but has been a bit broken recently and so DAI price, it's hard to say whether it's due to Tether news or whether it's due to stability fee increases, has maintained kind of its strength in the face of what's been going on with increasing ETH price.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003416>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h34m16s">00:34:16</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So just go back to here, so ETH price has been consistently increasing over the past week or so, everyone's been very excited. But at the same time, DAI prices held relatively steady or even increasing in that time period. So whether that's due to stability fees or whether that's due to Tether news and other factors is very hard to say, but it is definitely a positive indicator.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003439>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h34m39s">00:34:39</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So DAI supply has been consistently coming down with the recent stability fee increases. I think this is the most clear and measurable impact of the stability fee changes and then we can sort of talk about what's the relationship between DAI supply and DAI price? And I think that's a little bit more complex, but it is to me, fairly clear that the increasing stability fees has had an impact on DAI supply.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003506>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h35m06s">00:35:06</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>There have been very few large draws recently and there have been some significant wipes about two weeks ago and then three weeks ago.

So that to me is a very important health indicator for the system, because I think it will be important to maintain a strong circulation to achieve homeostasis as Rich mentioned.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003718>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h37m18s">00:37:18</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So there's been a lot of discussion about these secondary lending platforms, their role with Maker. I think there's not a lot new to report here. The rates and volumes have held fairly steady on these secondary lending platforms, kind of hovering around that 14, 14.5 level. So effectively, what this says to me is the Dharma, Compound, NEO was mentioned. A few of these kinds of platforms have really nestled into that secondary lending relationship with Maker, where people would tend to refinance their loans onto those platforms or would instead try to purchase DAI and lend it out on those platforms.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003804>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h38m04s">00:38:04</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>There's been a lot of discussion about whether that actually positively impacts DAI price, I don't feel the use case of people lending that DAI out on those secondary platforms, necessarily improves the DAI price, because it doesn't overall impact the supply. But what is interesting is the amount of DAI that gets locked up in those platforms, that is not necessarily lent out is generally a positive for the circulating supply. And then a positive in the sense that it's good, but it's a negative. And then the other factor is, if people are taking out loans and refinancing them on those secondary platforms, that does not have an overall effect on DAI supply, but could be a positive for DAI price.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003851>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h38m51s">00:38:51</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>And then I don't want to eat up too much time, draws have been low, so there's not much to say about new versus old. The collateralization ratio, so this has been interesting, where as I mentioned, DAI supply has been consistently going down, but the collateralization ratio has been kind of consistently increasing over the past week or two.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003914>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h39m14s">00:39:14</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So the total amount of DAI has been going, down the denominator has been going down, but the ratio has overall been going up. So the amount of frees has been outweighing the amount of locks recently. So effectively, people have been taking more collateral out, but not as much as the DAI supply has been decreasing, which kind of makes sense, in that people are going to hold their collateralization ratios within a relative range. But they've been okay with deleveraging the amount of DAI that they have relative to that ETH.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#003949>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h39m49s">00:39:49</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>So again, that is to me a positive indicator because as people seek more and more leverage on Maker, that depresses the DAI price. So this is potentially a sort of intermediate variable that we can observe, that is not the independent driver, but definitely, I think has a relationship to what's going on with DAI price. And that people are sort of maybe letting their foot off the gas a little bit, in terms of how much leverage they're seeking.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004016>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h40m16s">00:40:16</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>Not much to say on the individual transactions.

So a CDP, like often CDPs could be opened early on and have very little activity and so in that sense, that CDP would be very old, but if a large quantity of debt was drawn recently, the debt, the age of the DAI would be very low. So they're not the same at all.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004126>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h41m26s">00:41:26</a></td> <td align=left>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td align=left>And I actually tend to think that the number of CDPs, the age of CDPs, the amount of activity in CDPs is not a super important metric.

And here's where I like to tell everybody, please explain it to me like I'm five. So is this primarily the friction of getting the premium associated with the friction of getting in and out of DAI, is the reason why perhaps 98.9 or whatever is the real price of DAI?</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004500>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h45m00s">00:45:00</a></td> <td align=left>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td align=left>No, I think it's not the transaction cost friction, but rather the nonequivalence of DAI and an actual US dollar, in compositional terms. I mean one DAI is not quite literally $1, it's designed to track $1 and if there's always going to be that lapse in confidence, that little gap where these two things aren't identical in makeup, then there might be some risk premium there that needs to be filled up.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#004534>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=00h45m34s">00:45:34</a></td> <td align=left>Richard Brown</td> <td align=left>Isn't that sort of a function of what people are using? It has to do with demand though, so if people are using DAI as collateral or as a transaction or a settlements token or something, then yeah, there's a lot of friction there.

So it's like if you have access to open books from some guy who is doing OTC trading in transparent way, the quantity of inventory that if he's getting too much DAI, then it's like probably the peg isn't going well.

But I think the risk of that, I haven't pulled the date on this just yet, but I think the risk of that has been practically relatively low.

The more that we increase the DSR, whatever we start at, fine, X. Ultimately, we're going to be able to pull the aggregate stability fee down.

How long will that last? I don't know the answer to that, but at some point if we set the DSR to X and then have to make it 2X to make it more competitive and the stability fee as an overall factor can drop from 16 or 19, whatever it is, down to say 10 and then down to five and then as we slowly pull the DSR in, the challenges with those secondary markets is that they're going to in effect be squeezed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=left><a href=./#012037>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz33SskUj7o&t=01h20m37s">01:20:37</a></td> <td align=left>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td align=left>The question will be, how do they remain competitive?
