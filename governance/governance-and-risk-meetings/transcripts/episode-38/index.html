We have a more interesting ... we're shaking things up a bit; I shouldn't say more interesting because they're always interesting. But we're doing something a little different today.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000020></a><a href=#000020>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h00m20s">00:00:20</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We've been talking, in the last few calls about the need to start transitioning away from focusing exclusively on the peg. Even before that, we talked about how these calls will have different themes based on what the subject matter is. Previously, they've been focused exclusively on supply and demand and balance. It's too early to say that we're out of the woods in that area, but I think that we're past the point where it requires a full hours meeting every week in order to manage. We'll still be touching on it, but there's a lot that needs to be discussed in these calls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000059></a><a href=#000059>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h00m59s">00:00:59</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We're going to be improving governance; the way that governance works in the next couple weeks or months. We need to start discussing what that might look like. And of course, we have multi-collateral DAI coming at us soon, trademark, and we need to get prepared for that, and that means we need to talk about collateral risk and happily, we have a series of experts on the call today which are going to start setting the stage for us. I'll hand that off to Cyrus in a second.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000127></a><a href=#000127>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h01m27s">00:01:27</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Before we get too deep in the weeds though, I want to repeat the same preamble that I do every week. We have a lot to go over in these calls, far too much for us to handle with a back and forth, or with a few moderators speaking. So, I'm going to post a link into the Zoom group chat, which is a link to our r/mkrgov subreddit. In that subreddit every week, we have a thread; in that thread, there is an agenda for the call that we're having right now. There is also a summary of the call that gets posted there in a couple hours after we're finished, and that's where I would like people to continue the discussion and continue the debate, dig into issues, surface some more, and then keep the conversation going. Because there isn't enough time today to do all of the things we need to do. If you have questions that didn't get addressed in the call, please add them to that thread. Next week, if you feel that there's things that you would like us to address in the calls, and you see the agenda thread come up on Reddit, please feel free to pre populate, let's front-load some questions into these things so we have things to address or we know, or we know what's on people's radars when we come into these calls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000251></a><a href=#000251>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h02m51s">00:02:51</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The other part of my preamble is that we are very, very, very interested in having people in this call join into the discussion and that means that we want people to ask questions, offer their comments, offer their insights. So if you have something you'd like to say, and you have a microphone, please just jump in immediately and start saying it, or ask the question. If you don't have a microphone, type your question into the group chat and one of the moderators will be keeping an eye on those things and we will ask your questions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000319></a><a href=#000319>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h03m19s">00:03:19</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We also have some additional functionality with our transition to Zoom today, where people are able to raise their hands. There's some other functionality that we'll be introducing soon with breakout rooms and light voting and signaling and stuff like that. But until then, let's take it step by step. So, if you have a question, you can attempt to raise your hand in the participants window, and possibly we'll see it. Otherwise, you can just, like I said, put your question in the chat and we'll read it out.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000351></a><a href=#000351>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h03m51s">00:03:51</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>That's probably it for the preamble today. I am going to talk briefly about governance and then I'll hand it off to Cyrus for a significant amount of things that he needs to get us familiar with this week.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000402></a><a href=#000402>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h04m02s">00:04:02</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The theme for my chat today, is brevity, number one. Secondarily, it's securing the DAO. And this is something that I would like to keep on reinforcing because we've been talking about some issues around governance, and the issues that we're having around governance are not crypto-issues and they're not MakerDAO issues. They are human nature issues. We have a voting system that we need people to participate in. We need people to feel like they're engaged in that process. We need people to feel like they understand how it is they can best contribute to this. And we need them to [inaudible 00:04:40].</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000443></a><a href=#000443>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h04m43s">00:04:43</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We need them to feel like they can make a difference. Like I said, these are things that are common to every single voting system that's ever been created in the history of humanity. As far as I'm aware, the solutions to these problems are just communication and outreach and putting the right tooling in front of people. There's no magic bullets here.

It's very hard to say that for sure, but I think given increased variability of prices below a dollar, but still volume weighted, remaining close to a dollar, I think is a data point that evidences that case.

Partly, it makes sense since the stability fee has come down in the past few weeks, but it also, I think, was a big initial burst, especially with Compound v2 being recent released, dYdX starting to pick up some steam.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002349></a><a href=#002349>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=00h23m49s">00:23:49</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Inherently, I think those things would have driven an initial spike in refinancing.

I do think there is like a certain, minimum level of resolution that we'll never be able to act faster than in the way things are currently structured, and that's probably like a three to five day timescale.

We're totally safe from everything. We've had, I don't know, a couple hundred liquidations and they've all been great." In fact, the collateralization cold be argued to be too high.

Let's assume for a second that regardless of how quickly an asset moved up or down, how volatile it was, that you could liquidate the entire collateral at spot with no slippage. Doesn't matter what the asset is. As soon as it hits the liquidation price, you can just dump all of it. In that case, no matter how risky the asset is, you could just set 100% collateralization ratio, because you could just dump it as soon as it hits the threshold. The only remaining risk is this jump risk where it just shoots over that threshold where you actually can't dump it. It essentially just goes straight to zero. That's the extreme edge case. But what we care about for the credit risk and a stability fee is that jump risk where it literally just blows through your thresholds.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010754></a><a href=#010754>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h07m54s">01:07:54</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>The collateralization ratio is just walking back that edge case a bit and saying, "Well, there are these intermediary ..." there is a cost associated to liquidations, so let's say for selling a batch of collateral, you incurred 33% slippage. Every time you tried to sell 1000, you'd take that much slippage. Then you might want to, I don't know, put a collateralization ratio that is at 150%, so as soon as it hits the liquidation price, by the time you're finished signing the collateral, you've just broken even. The collateralization ratio, I like to think of it as this metric of expected slippage, or expected liquidation amount during the auctions. It's slightly unrelated to the default risk or the liquidation risk of the CDP as a whole.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010909></a><a href=#010909>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h09m09s">01:09:09</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>The risk premium is more concerned about what is the likelihood of the CDP being repaid and to what extent?

In that case, market risk does translate into [inaudible 01:10:05] asset, but how would collateralization of that asset overall responds to those market risks matters? Because if you consider ETH today, versus even four or five months ago, there's a completely different risk profile on Maker, because Maker holders, even though DAI supply has come up, have continued to increase the margin and hold more collateral per DAI. It's almost like the fundamental behaviors have changed. People have gotten maybe more risk averse, or maybe they've learned. It's hard to say why this has happened, but the fundamental risk profile is methodically different now, because if ETH dropped 30% today, you'd be far less likely to result in any bad debt than you would have four or five months ago.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011103></a><a href=#011103>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h11m03s">01:11:03</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>Right. This concept of changing risk profiles to MakerDAO is going to be another key aspect here, is that different asset price environments for our collateral portfolio leads to a different distribution of the way CDPs look. You can define a CDP through the amount of debt it has, through its collateralization ratio, and etc. Different market environments lead to different CDP distributions, which will necessarily require different primaries and risk approaches, depending on what we're trying to achieve. That's going to be a governance issue, I think, though. In theory we can know how we would want to handle different risk profiles. Actually, executing it through governance is going to be a different question entirely.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011213></a><a href=#011213>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h12m13s">01:12:13</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>Let's talk a little bit about the qualitative assessments, and potentially a good jumping off point for the community to get started on contributing to some of the risk work we're doing. Essentially, when we are considering a new collateral type, well, the first consideration is how does that collateral type even appear on our doorstep? I think we have to come to consensus on some sort of generally agreed upon onboarding approach. I think it's probably not a good idea to just have any one person or one entity just come and submit a bunch of collateral types for you and say, "Here, this is what you should even look at." That presents some interesting challenges, too, in a same sense that, along with the governance polls, in terms of trying to come to consensus of how to even run certain aspects of the polls, we could run into certain situations here.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011339></a><a href=#011339>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h13m39s">01:13:39</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>But essentially, the first step is how do we even bring collateral types to the plate for review? I don't think there's a great answer for that today, given that we haven't gone through that process yet. But let's assume we have a few different collateral types to evaluate. I think there needs to be some sort of a prioritization methodology for how we order them and decide to discuss them. I think this can be weighted by the perceived safety of the collateral, just at a high level, probably want to filter out the more unsavory collateral types. I think there should also be some weighting given to the potential of DAI being generated from the collateral type. Obviously, we want to go after high value collateral first. Then potentially, also some determination of how uncorrelated it is with the rest of our portfolio.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011450></a><a href=#011450>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h14m50s">01:14:50</a></td> <td>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td>Is it [inaudible 01:14:51] to have a more short term DAI outstanding with a [inaudible 01:14:56], or DAI if it's outstanding with a long time horizon, or intentional-</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011501></a><a href=#011501>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h15m01s">01:15:01</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>That's a great question.

Anyways, this is all at a very high level. This is under the situation where we could all of a sudden have 200 collateral types in the queue. Unfortunately, the governance call does not afford enough time to go through all that, at least not in its current iteration. Of course, I think we'd all like to see as many collateral types being supported as possible.

Let's assume we've done that and we want to just work our way down the list. I think the okay process for evaluating collateral types starts with a three step process, first step being classification of the collateral, second step being a due diligence, and third step being a risk analysis. I'm going to just quickly run through these three steps. One of the most important determinations is are these collateral assets ... they are bearer assets or not? I think that's the primary aspect we're concerned with when it comes to classification.

Bearer assets are essentially if you owning the asset comes without any counter party risk, such as owning physical gold or Bitcoin or Ether. This is important in this context of liquidations and trying to sell off the collateral asset. Currently, with the way Ether works, it gets purchased by the keepers and the liquidation aspect is done and we all move on. But potentially with security tokens or any sort of non-bearer asset, we have to keep in mind what the recourse process behind that looks like if we're to expect this orderly and efficient liquidation process. I think first step, really, with collateral asset is just classifying it. What kind of asset is it? Furthermore, bearer assets can be subdivided into the different crypto asset models that we're all familiar with, governance tokens, work tokens, utility tokens, all that kind of stuff. Then registered assets or security tokens, they can be whatever, equity tokens, bond tokens, and so forth. Next step would be to do a due diligence. Due diligence requires just a careful examination of the collateral asset and everything that's associated with it, looking at the team, looking at the technology, looking at the business line behind it, looking at the token, style, [inaudible 01:20:00], so forth, all the nitty gritty [crosstalk 01:20:02].

This goes aligned with the due diligence. But essentially, our goal here is to uncover anything that might cause a sudden crash in collateral asset value, simple example being a protocol risk or bug exploits and so forth. For example, due diligence report covers shoddy code or shoddy coding practices, then you might obviously assign a larger risk to this collateral asset.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012112></a><a href=#012112>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAYQZStoysQ&t=01h21m12s">01:21:12</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>Other examples of due diligence revealing certain risk factors is valuation frameworks for various token models.

Just naturally, people have expertise in various areas. If you're looking to get involved in the quantitative side of things, anything with risk modeling and evaluating market trading history and all that stuff, is definitely a lot to do there.
