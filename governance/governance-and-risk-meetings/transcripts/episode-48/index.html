And I know we've talked about how we're putting on different collateral types; which ones are ... each as we vote them in, but we really, as a general understanding, I don't really think we've got a general consensus about how we're going to get where exactly we're going. We know where we're going to go in five years. We know which in theory collaterals are coming on because we have a process on how to onboard them, but do we have the exact plan on when we launch the DSR comparative to the collateral?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000051></a><a href=#000051>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h00m51s">00:00:51</a></td> <td>Matthew Rabinowitz</td> <td>My concern is that we just kind of hodgepodge and smush it all together, and we'll end up with a scenario where we have trouble distinguishing signals of, what do we do with the DSR? Is that more important than doing extra collateral types? Or are collateral types more important than doing the DSR?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000110></a><a href=#000110>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h01m10s">00:01:10</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>That's a timely question to ask, and so obviously it ties back into this thing where there's obviously this sense in the community that not a lot has been going on and we've been wrestling with trying to make sure a lot is going on, but also falling down and letting the community know that a lot is going on. So, that's on us. Happily, though, all of your questions are going to be answered this week. At least, we're going to add 50,000 more questions, because that's what I want to get into in this call. And I'll start droning on about that in a couple of minutes, but the calendar, every ... I shouldn't say every single step. Maybe 30, 40 steps that need to occur between now and multi-collateral DAI launch have been mapped out, described, and loosely placed, assigned a date and that's going to be released today, sometime after the call.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000212></a><a href=#000212>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h02m12s">00:02:12</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So, the community is going to have this opportunity to take a look at exactly how much time is allocated to each one of these steps, how much time we're allocating to the DSR, how long we're going to talk about Oracles, we're going to talk about the risk teams, we're going to talk about the general model when we begin the onboarding process, how long, what that onboarding process looks like. So, the answer is it's all going out today.

One of the major stakeholders obviously is the governance ecosystem, governance in risk in the community needs to do a pile of work in order to set us up. The foundation itself needs to complete a bunch of development work, it needs to complete a bunch of security and auditing work, other miscellaneous administrative tasks need to completed. Our partner, third party ecosystem and our partners need to complete some work as well. And so that's why it's so difficult to come up with an authoritative road map because these three large groups of stakeholders need to get their dependency chains in order and sort of execute around the same time frames. So that's why we don't publish hard dates at MakerDAO, we're trying to get as close as we possibly can, but once these three things align we go live with MCD.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001247></a><a href=#001247>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h12m47s">00:12:47</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The area of concern for this group though is the first group that I talked about and that's governance, risk and community.

Here's the segue. I'm going to start reading liberally from the forum post. But in a nutshell the interim governance facilitators are tasked with ensuring a smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance and scheduling them. Essentially this role is about facilitation. It's not a decision making role, it's not an authoritative role, it doesn't set ... well, I shouldn't say that. It does set policy and procedure in conjunction with working with the community, but it doesn't make governance decisions. This role isn't empowered to decide that everybody should vote for X or that time for voting for this new thing, Y, needs to start happening arbitrarily. It's about facilitating and working with the community so it's an evolution of what's already been happening.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001410></a><a href=#001410>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h14m10s">00:14:10</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The governance facilitator works with stakeholders in the governance threads, in the chats, in these calls and identifies emergent process, helps to refine workflows, helps to encourage the community to work together in an open sourcy type manner to generate usable pieces or work that we can all agree upon and then transitions that work from the community into the governance infrastructure proper. One of the primary responsibilities for this role is making sure that there is this clear path from a forum thread where someone says, "Hey I have a good idea," to it eventually showing up in the governance portal.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001453></a><a href=#001453>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h14m53s">00:14:53</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>And that's where we've had friction in the past and a lot of meta questions have arised, primarily around signal generation. We've had lots of really interesting posts in the subreddit that have gone unanswered or that haven't been pursued. We have lots of interesting post in the forum now.

And that's essentially what the governance facilitator role is in nutshell. Is ensuring that from idea to governance decision, that that pipeline has been fully explored, defined and adhered to. The goal here though is that it's not governance facilitator that makes up all that stuff, it's the community that does all that and the governance facilitator there just makes sure that everybody's following the communities rules and they've been formalized, and understood and published.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001619></a><a href=#001619>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h16m19s">00:16:19</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So those are the very broad strokes. No questions yet so I am going to go over the part of the forum thread that just outlines the rules and the responsibilities. Because ultimately this is a lot like a job description and whether the community accepts this proposal is technically in line with whether they accept the concept of this being a role that the organization, and the foundation, and the community at large needs. So primary responsibilities for a governance facilitator, number one, ownership and management of the official communication channels.

Governance is a hard problem, it's going to be an increasingly hard problem in predicting the edge cases and how hard and in what form that hard problem is going to take in the future is very, very difficult. So difficult is, as you go farther out into the future, it becomes meaningless to speculate. So part of this governance role is to help the community define exactly the role of the governance facilitator should be, defining what governance should look like, defining what a consensus actually means, defining what a process looks like, defining what work looks like.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001819></a><a href=#001819>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h18m19s">00:18:19</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So, it's basically a meta role whose job is to figure out what the processes are that manages the roles that people with meta roles, so it's a bit circular, but the governance facilitator is about working with the community to figure out exactly what it is the community wants from governance and making sure that that happens.

Everybody agrees that that's a great question, but people at the foundation is fantastically busy and these things don't get followed up on. So the concept of advocacy is big for me. Somebody in the community, potentially is the facilitator, would be responsible for saying, okay that's a great question, I'm going to find out and I'm now obligated to find that answer for you and let you know what it is.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002316></a><a href=#002316>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h23m16s">00:23:16</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>To David's earlier question, this role primarily is about bootstrapping.

And that's where we've lost some traction in the governance ecosystem up until this point. People want to do things, but how do we determine whether a poll should happen?

That's not very global of us. So the goal for the governance facilitator is that in each one of the major regions we have additional governance facilitators. One in the APAC, LATAM, EMEA, all over the place. We have these governance facilitators repeating these same concerns and processes and conversations and paradigms to the rest of the world and those facilitators can all work together to coordinate and then eventually in some glorious future, the foundation just steps aways and lets the community governance facilitators just do it themselves.

We need to collaborate in online forums, we need to reach consensus about ideas, we need to commit documents into a repo for version control, we need to iterate on those documents and the issues against them, and then we need to put them somewhere people can see it so in pretty presentation there.

It's my expectation that we create this mandate ... well, we've created the mandate. We release it to the community, we talk about it for a couple weeks. People say yes or they say no. We iterate if they say yes, we go with it and then in two or three months some omission or problem arises and we change it. And then we ratify that role again and now we've improved things. That's the way that governance has been happening up until this point. I've said this before, but that's the best thing about the way that MakerDAO does governance, is that it's always better than it was last month.

And the examples we have so far in that world are the governance facilitator and the risk teams.

It can be philosophically, and we can make our best efforts to make it pure and behave as if it was, but until these roles are created by the community and being paid for by the community, there is not pure autonomy.

I wanted to show that DeFi's actually at all time high. If you can see, there's some other metrics. The collateral metrics are represented in terms of risk but probably not really in terms in actual usage if DeFi service, if you want to call it that way.

Collateral in Maker fell mostly because of refinancings of larger CDPs to Compound where much lower collateralization ratio is required, but also because a lot of large CDPs that have moved collateral from the system as they either deleverage after bull run it, or either because their collateralization ratio was already high right? Or as you can see here, some of the largest DBT's collateralization ratio reached 600%. Of course they have most collateral because they were well above liquidation ratio.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004520></a><a href=#004520>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h45m20s">00:45:20</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>Also someone wants to actually focus on collateral metrics, I think it's much better to look at the median amount of Ether logged in CDPs, because this tells you about the borrowing production amongst retail and not so much about what rates are doing.

The leveraging from the Ether bull run. What they want to say is that the nature of CDP usage and borrowing itself will always lead to high volatility of collateral locked. Because it's shown in one of my presentations in last calls, huge amount of Ether that's actually locked comes directly from leverage and directly from trading the issued DAI and Ether unlocking it again into collateral and estimation here is about 20%. And you can see here clearly that the appetite for leverage decreased in last month of course because Ether price dropped and that was kind of expected. And we could see that probably CDPs are much more inclined to deleverage, monetize profits, remove collateral, repay them and so on.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004657></a><a href=#004657>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h46m57s">00:46:57</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>To conclude, what I wanted to show is that collateral metric is really more of a risk metric of the system. I relate it to general appetite for leverage. Of course this fell last month because Ether price fell but this doesn't necessarily mean that DAI usage is falling or DeFi usage is falling. It's not entirely clear what DAI usage entails, but if you ask me, still much of the DAI transactions are due to borrowing it and selling it short for crypto mostly Ether. And if you look at outstanding DAI borrowed, the different platforms, mostly at Maker, Compound and through dYdX, the bigger spot you can actually see that we're at all time high. So there's about 110 million of DAI borrowed on those platforms.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004751></a><a href=#004751>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h47m51s">00:47:51</a></td> <td>Primoz Kordez</td> <td>And if you add USDC trade which is also becoming an important token that's borrowed you end up with 113 million of stable coins borrowed and that's again a record and you can see this here, right?

Some of you might be familiar with so called holder waves that Bitcoin analyst use when trying to size the patterns of Bitcoin hodlers and how is this related to Bitcoin price.

Or in one day you can see 10 to up to 15, 16% of coins were transacted in a day. This levels are really high and I think no other crypto actually can compare with this and that's actually greatness for DAI adoption. So I hope this helps to better understand what metrics need to be considered when estimating either risk of DeFi or when estimating the lending activity or when estimate onchain transaction activity such as this because those are all totally different things.

About how we consider through filtering of transaction values used to get to better or less gameable approximation of how much is actual usage. And I think that one of the things that really improved was looking at sort of a net transaction value after like a delay period right? So it's harder to gain value by saying, hey, I'm going to exchange his DAI back and forth and if that delay period is one hour right? So if it's a washed trade or something over the course of one hour, that's more easily gameable. If you net it out over, net transaction value over say a week or a month, it's must harder to game that because them somebody has to pay the cost of holding those assets for that time period.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005338></a><a href=#005338>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h53m38s">00:53:38</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>Yeah, good point.

So if there's a transfer from B to C and a transfer from C back to B, if they're perfectly equivalent, then it's net zero.

I mean very strong for like the past month or so, definitely not quite record setting. Most trades were either just above or just below a dollar. The volume weighted average price was slightly above a dollar. These, broadly DAI is trading pretty well at the moment so a big portion of this was unfortunately selling ETH for DAI which tends to help stabilize the DAI price because there's a fairly large quantity of liquidations recently. You can also see that here, there's about a little over a million dollars worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours which is obvious with the ETH price drop.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005603></a><a href=#005603>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h56m03s">00:56:03</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So just one other thing I wanted to touch on was it wasn't the actual topic of Primoz's tweet, but it is worth mentioning, sort of that relative role in the market share of what's going on with DAI versus USDC versus secondary lending platforms. I think there's been a fair amount of like FUD recently around DAI recently, at least on Twitter, and I think people like to glum onto sensationalist stories so I think it's good to take a good, hard, critical, data driven look at that and understand what's going on. So obviously we've addressed the whole collateralization ratio component, but the other component is USDC market share, secondary lending market share versus DAI supply.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005654></a><a href=#005654>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h56m54s">00:56:54</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So the DAI supply is down to about 78 million, but that's been fairly consistent over, as you can see here.

So we saw this sort of this cratering of the excess in the end of July, beginning of August, especially with what was going on with InstaDapp and things like that. And what we've seen is that utilization rate has come down with the DAI supply. So there is a little bit less demand for leverage, but is that being caused by Compound? Is that being caused by you know people switching over to USDC? Not necessarily, it's primarily a function of what's going on with ETH price right now. And that should sort of continue to improve, A) as ETH price gets cheaper, we will see an increase in leverage on ETH when the price is right to the market. I think we may be starting to a little bit of that actually now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005855></a><a href=#005855>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h58m55s">00:58:55</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But as that demand for leverage picks up the transaction volume for DAI, which Primoz showed, is fairly consistently high lately. So DAI is getting used, it's just there was significantly more DAI that had been minted prior than was used because there's primarily just being sold for leverage and then supplied to secondary lending platforms for a yield by the purchasers on those decentralised exchanges. So essentially I think a little bit of that FUD is unwarranted as the conclusion. Obviously, you know, things are down a little bit when ETH is down significantly, but if ETH sort of sustains these price levels and that DAI usage continues to grow, I think you're likely to see somewhat of a recovery.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005950></a><a href=#005950>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=00h59m50s">00:59:50</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But the really interesting thing will be what Maker holders sort of start to do with regards to the rates. So we see these borrow rates on secondary lending platforms have come back down, so in tandem with that utilization, so now there is a bit more excess that exists on the secondary lending platforms. So it's sort of a tenuous situation, the moment where you could decide to lower the stability fee in a effort to make leverage a little bit more attractive now, it's likely that DAI, the way it's trading, and the relative stability it's enjoyed over the last couple of weeks, could sustain a slightly lower stability fee. I mean that would definitely I think help push up some of the leverage, but I think we need to be very careful about reducing that stability fee when there's a significant excess supply here that's effectively this should track pretty well with through this invisible metric that we've always had of what is the over-supply, which is basically an implied metric of what is demand.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010105></a><a href=#010105>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h01m05s">01:01:05</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So as this spread kind of continues to widen, what you're effectively seeing is a little bit of over-supply, not necessarily increase, but at the very least an increase of the amount of that over-supply that is captured by the secondary lending platforms.

And there was a lot of discussion on some of the first posts on the governance forum where basically people were raising this idea that the high stability fee, low stability fee would have very little impact on the price in either direction, and that the price was going to do what the price was going to do regardless of what the stability fee was.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010351></a><a href=#010351>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h03m51s">01:03:51</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Now, obviously that's extremely generous and I don't think accurate, but it's not necessarily true that the opposite is the case where if you just jack up the stability fee, you're not necessarily going to make DAI stable and if you lower the stability fee, DAI is going to become unstable. It's like moving a single piece on a ship and the wind is a very, very important directive. Moving that piece obviously has an impact, but I think moving it at the right times is the most important thing.

And then week four, we wrap that up and we prepare ourselves for an executive vote to add those collateral types into the system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012610></a><a href=#012610>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h26m10s">01:26:10</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Then potentially we do it again. We do it again, we do it again. That's sort of what the future basically looks like for governance, with the caveat that this is all subject to discussion and feedback and debate, but these are the broad strokes. Definitely worth reviewing, because the interim governance facilitator role is a significant milestone in what it is we're up to. But the calendar is where a lot of the weighty, important stuff is at, so have a look and that'll give everyone an indication of what the future is going to hold for us.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012652></a><a href=#012652>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h26m52s">01:26:52</a></td> <td>LongForWisdom</td> <td>Says initial thing like [inaudible 01:26:54] is that ... seems quite cramped for discussion of these things for like two weeks from I'm not sure, proposal to poll, and onchain stuff.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012704></a><a href=#012704>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h27m04s">01:27:04</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>It does.

So, we could very easily determine that two weeks is just not realistic, or we could determine that the level of interest is not there. Nobody has responded to this thread in a week, and then obviously two weeks is too long, so we might as well just move ahead with this thing. There's so many questions we all need to answer, so this is where we start, and then we start fleshing things out and fixing it as we go.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012745></a><a href=#012745>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h27m45s">01:27:45</a></td> <td>LongForWisdom</td> <td>Yeah, for ...</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012749></a><a href=#012749>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqwCNjUXnI&t=01h27m49s">01:27:49</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Okay.
