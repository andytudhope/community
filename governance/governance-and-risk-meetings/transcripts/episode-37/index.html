turned on for anyone else? Oh, there it goes. All right everyone, welcome to the May 30<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting, with MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I am going to moderate the call today and talk a bit about governance and the recent votes. After that, we will talk to Cyrus Younessi who represents the risk team at MakerDAO and he's going to in turn introduce us to a bunch of really talented members of the community who are also helping us out with risk. And then after that, we're going to hear from Cyrus who will start digging into collateral types and collateral risk, which is an interesting conversation we need to have as an entire community over the course of the next weeks, months, leading up to multi-collateral DAI.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000052></a><a href=#000052>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h00m52s">00:00:52</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>And then afterwards if there is significant interest, we'll have a Q&amp;A session that could possibly run past the top of the hour. We'll stick around until energy begins to wane. Generally we've been hanging out for a half hour after these calls and just doing a general Q&amp;A and there's been a lot of interesting conversation. So if you're interested, please hang out for that.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000114></a><a href=#000114>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h01m14s">00:01:14</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>My preamble I am going to jump into again is that we are intensely intensely interested in getting as much feedback and questions, comments and concerns from the community as we possibly can. We have an enormously talented group of people in these calls and we want to know what they're thinking and get as much from them as we possibly can. Sorry [inaudible 00:01:38] for a second there, I'm digging up a link. So I'm going to past this in the chat on the side. If people have questions or comments, please type them out in the chat and we will attempt to get to those and when there's a quiet moment, we'll read them out for you.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000150></a><a href=#000150>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h01m50s">00:01:50</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>If you have access to a microphone please jump in and just start talking. There's no rules against interruptions here. If you think there's a thread that we picked up or dropped that needs to be explored more completely, please jump into the Reddit thread that I just posted, and let's continue the conversation there because as always, this is a forum for us to discuss and to debate and to explore things and to surface new issues and to discuss memes and/or educate ourselves and the rest of the community, but we don't really make decisions here. We make decisions through the voting portal, and we have deeper debates in Reddit over the course of the week. And so please make sure that your thoughts and concerns are known and recorded in those threads.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000242></a><a href=#000242>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h02m42s">00:02:42</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Generally we have Steven come in and give us the thought of the week, but one of the main themes of these calls is that we're iterating every single time trying to improve things, trying to tighten things up a bit. And one of the things we're trying to do is to... one of the ideas we're wrestling with are how much information we pack into this one call, this single call, how many calls do we need to have in the future, what should the agenda of those calls be, who should we advertise them to. There's a lot of questions we need to answer. Do we need a separate risk call, do we need three or four different separate risk calls, do we need one governance call for monetary policy, do we need another governance call for things like the DSR, the stability fee. There's all kinds of questions that need to be addressed.

Some issues, concerns that we knew could happen in the voting system and we've addressed it in a way that we anticipated that we would have to. And that concern is that we have a continuous approval voting system where the idea is that maker holders signal one picture of the system or a new picture of the system. And as they have a chance to view how the ecosystem is behaving and the market is behaving, the peg is behaving, they decide whether they want the new executive to be ratified or whether they're happy with the old executive.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000520></a><a href=#000520>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h05m20s">00:05:20</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>In the past, we got... our past about two months, we got used to this idea of a... we got wrapped up in this thing which I call sometimes "the new normal", where because something had happened a few times in a row, we assumed that that's the way that the world is going to be from this point forward. And that's a risky thing to fall into. And that new normal assumption was that every Friday, Maker holders would immediately jump into the voting portal, they would pick whichever the new vote was because new is obviously better than old. Then we would proceed to enjoy the success of our governance system and one day we'd have a poll that was based on that very clear picture of the system that we all understood, which was clarify the previous [inaudible 00:06:05].</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000606></a><a href=#000606>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h06m06s">00:06:06</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>The last two weeks some interesting things happened. A bunch of interesting things happened. The peg largely stabilized, air quotes and caveats apply. I'm not really qualified to figure out whether it has or not, but it seems like it has. A lot of the voters seemed to have shared that same opinion and there wasn't a mad rush to raise and or lower the fee on the Friday two weeks ago. And there wasn't one on the weekend either, and there wasn't one during the course of the week. And we ran into this situation where we began having polls that didn't reflect the current state of the system. They reflected what potentially the future state of the system might look like, irrespective of what the main voters were doing with the actual stability fee itself.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000651></a><a href=#000651>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h06m51s">00:06:51</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So we had the stability fee at 19. There was a significant amount of signaling that wanted it to go to 17, so we saw a disconnect between signalers and the polling infrastructure and actual voters... or people staking their weight against the actual executive. That was something that we need to learn about. It also surfaced some issues that we have with the system in general, which is that our requirements are evolving faster than the governance portal is evolving. And one of those things we've run into, which obviously we all knew we would, is that you can only vote for one thing at a time, and that includes a poll. So if you have your MKR staked on a poll that says you want to lower the fee, you need to take it out of a current executive that is lowering the fee or vice versa. And if you want to vote for a lower fee, you need to take it out of the poll and that changes the signal.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000749></a><a href=#000749>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h07m49s">00:07:49</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So we have all kinds of issues we're addressing there and we've spoken about in previous calls.

Happily that ambiguity was cleared up this week and there's some very interesting things that happened here that I want to explore a bit, or at least put on people's radars is that the significant amount of data that shows that the peg is probably stable-ish right now.

And that to me is very interesting for a few reasons. It sends a signal, beyond whether it should have been lowered or shouldn't have been, I don't know. But the great thing about that change is it signaled to the community that our fees are not marching ever upwards, that the voters are more than willing to lower those fees when they feel that it's required. That takes the steam or the wind out of a lot of people's sails in the contrarian MakerDAO community, which I enjoyed seeing. It also goes towards dispelling the myth that there's a correlation between the stability fee and the price of Maker, which is sort of a pernicious myth, and one that particularly annoys me because it's so immediately and obviously disprovable because if you look at the stability fees and you look at the price of Maker and you overlay the two graphs together, you can see that raising of stability fees is generally deleterious to the price of Maker.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000944></a><a href=#000944>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h09m44s">00:09:44</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>But this also provides some very interesting signals to the community, that the fee does go down, that it's not exclusively the domain of a bunch of money hungry plutarchs, and that ultimately... and this is the most important one, that there is a peg recovery in the future. And we've proven that that is a situation that can occur. And one of the interesting things we might see in the future now is that the next time that cheap DAI does show up on the markets or there's a sufficient supply overshoot, people now have empirical evidence that it will go back to the dollar.

But what's happening recently, which is odd but potentially healthy, is a little bit more immunity to some of those price movements in terms of what these equilibrium points are for DAI supply, for DAI price, for average age of debt. I think we're just seeing more stability all around, which is a good sign.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002239></a><a href=#002239>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h22m39s">00:22:39</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So I'm going to skip over the Compound section here for a second because I'll talk about that in a different context. But the percentage of new vs. old DAI, I mean we can talk about this but I think just the amount of DAI being drawn out has been relatively low lately. And this line has kind of dropped down, but to a fairly stable level. So effectively, there's kind of a more stable equilibrium point again of what I've been talking about between the amount of loans that are taken out on preexisting CDPs, vs. new CDPs being created and new loans being taken out on those.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002327></a><a href=#002327>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h23m27s">00:23:27</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So collateral is another really interesting topic, especially with regards to a lot of the ETH price movements, because there have been a few large sort of collateral removal events that have coincided with a few large increases in ETH price, which is kind of an interesting relationship if you think about it, because what we would generally expect is this collateralization ratio to hold relatively steady. In the past, it has held relatively steady. But with the May crypto spring, whatever the proper term is, that collateralization ratio shot up and has actually kind of wavered around this 530 percent line, despite a few large events in terms of ETH being taken out.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002422></a><a href=#002422>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h24m22s">00:24:22</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So, as ETH price appreciates, people decide, "Hey, I don't need to keep as much collateral in the system, I feel fairly safe, so I can back out of some of that capital cost." As opposed to what had happened in the past a bit, which is as ETH price had run up, people had kind of kept that buffer, and then taken that as a signal to draw more DAI out of the system. So what I'm just saying is that's a slightly different response to the same stimuli. So that suggests that the nature of the system has changed a bit. And so what I think this actually speaks to a lot more is the actual effect of the stability fee, and some of the economics that have been discovered, I guess I would say, with a lot of these secondary lending markets. I mean, you've heard probably anecdotally that dYdX has experienced significant volume. And there's been a lot more refinancing to some of these secondary platforms. And I think people are starting to see them as more of a viable place to get DAI, and I think as the demand for DAI increases, those are basically an efficiency function.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002540></a><a href=#002540>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=00h25m40s">00:25:40</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So let's say the demand for DAI is roughly 70 million, and there's sort of this 10 million buffer of oversupply, if that can get eaten up through a lot of lending on secondary markets, then what you could actually see is a more close tracking between DAI supply and DAI price. So if the demand for DAI significantly increased, you would have less of this buffer living on Maker and I think a lot more on the secondary lending platforms, and so you could see a more immediate effect from changes in demand.

And so there's always been kind of this buffer between the Maker rate and the rate on these secondary lending platforms.

I think it, in the absence of a savings rate, does lend an additional stability layer to Maker, and I think it is, from a biological standpoint, I think it's cropped up for a reason.

Whether or not it's a stability fee that causes or destroys supply, and the same thing with the DSR.

And so if you think about that, there's this margin or this buffer that exists between where the supply is and where the demand is.

One instructive example for evaluating collateral types is along those lines is looking at something like Bitcoin or Ether versus something like Tether, very different risk profiles, so for example, if you were to look at Tether purely based on its trading history, its past profile, you'd actually think it's probably pretty safe and obviously we know that to not be the case and looking at something like Bitcoin or Ether seems to be extremely volatile but in a lot of ways much safer than something like Tether.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010018></a><a href=#010018>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=01h00m18s">01:00:18</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>And so it will be interesting to unpack these different situations.

This is definitely a governance MKR-wide decision. And they can ultimately choose to add in as many as they want. On our end, all that we can control on the foundation risk team is how many assets we can properly evaluate in the limited time span given the natural overhead that goes into some of these evaluation processes and quantitative modeling. If an asset will generate growth [inaudible 01:27:35] collateral portfolio, and we'll have to kind of define what it means to make sense, then anything can be added, in theory. And so, you could have multiple different risk teams tackling different assets, and then they all get submitted and voted on all at once by the executive vote. Akiva, I was just about to answer your question. Yeah, I do know about the SPV model. And kind of a brief tldr, essentially, certain security tokens are obviously quite illiquid, and they're even more illiquid on crypto markets. Imagine trying to find a liquid market for tokens that represent some obscure real-world asset. So, the SPV model goes like this. So, the SPV is created and there are ERC20 tokens minted that represent a claim on the liquidated value of the assets in the real world.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012856></a><a href=#012856>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=01h28m56s">01:28:56</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>That was really confusing. If there's a liquidation occurs, the asset gets sold in the real world and then the SPV is legally obligated to convert the proceeds into DAI. And then the DAI would get sent to the ERC20 holders. The tokens represent a claim on that DAI. In the keeper auction, you would bid on $ 1 worth of DAI at hopefully a discount. And you would get the proceeds of the auction. I'm not sure if that entirely made sense.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012943></a><a href=#012943>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=01h29m43s">01:29:43</a></td> <td>Cyrus Younessi</td> <td>The goal is to source liquidity off chain and then flow the proceeds back to token holders enchain.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012952></a><a href=#012952>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmIaugA2fis&t=01h29m52s">01:29:52</a></td> <td>Akiva</td> <td>I think Greg said something in his speech where, something like that it actually doesn't represent the legal claim.
