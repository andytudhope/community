Welcome to the July 18<sup>th</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting at MakerDAO. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the Head of Community Development at Maker. We have a special guest today in the form of Alex Evans from Placeholder VC. We're anxiously looking forward to hearing from him.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000022></a><a href=#000022>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=00h00m22s">00:00:22</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I'm anxiously looking forward to somebody trying to get me to understand exactly what was going on in that document that he shared because it went completely over my head. So, hopefully, there'll be kind of like a preamble for that. Otherwise, I'm just going to nod sagely in the background.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000037></a><a href=#000037>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=00h00m37s">00:00:37</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I also want to keep things quiet as far as governance goes because I don't have a lot to go over and that's not because there's not a lot happening in governance. There is a fantastic amount of things in governance and all of that is going to be carpet bombing these meetings over the next couple of weeks of some presentations, some request for comments, some new forum debates about ways that we're hoping the community can come together and help us to optimize this process. Because believe it or not MCD is a real thing and it's coming soon, so we have a lot of work to do.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000111></a><a href=#000111>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=00h01m11s">00:01:11</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>This is one of the reasons it's so hard for us to get pinned down for a date on when an MCD happens is because this is a two stage process, basically. The first stage is to make our foundation, puts all the pieces in place. Many, many, many people get all their work finished and then the work depends on the community. Largely people that show up in this room, people that are showing up in the governance forum, but we have to rely on the community to help us do a great deal of work.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000146></a><a href=#000146>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=00h01m46s">00:01:46</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We need to evaluate these assets. We need to talk about the processes and the policies. We need to talk about what the voting cadence looks like. We need to get piles and piles and piles of feedback. For that to happen effectively we're going to need to formalize and internalize some of the emerging process that's coming out of the forums and that's going to happen over the course of the next few weeks.

One of them is the discussion thread for this call. We'll continue the discussion there after this has ended. David will provide us with a summary of all the salient points. There's a link also to the thread for Alex's model. There's also a link to something that LongForWisdom is turning into a forum rockstar for us has been posting ... is this the first of the second I'm not sure.

There's really three reasons why we went with this approach. The first one is it just gels really well with the way that smart contract based financial applications work and architected and that they are ... they're build on Ethereum that's a state machine and so they think about the world in terms of states and transactions representing transitions from one state to another. What these models allow us to do is they incorporate this idea of state and state transition very naturally and intuitively with very few assumptions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001110></a><a href=#001110>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=00h11m10s">00:11:10</a></td> <td>Alex Evans</td> <td>The second one is these models were designed historically for the types of instruments that had state dependent pay off. When we come to MKR we really care about let's say how long a loan stays open or whether a loan is bitten or is liked or ends up in some other state. And so, that is a perfect application of that kind of framework because it's built for those kinds of derivatives and financial instruments that have these state dependent pay offs.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001136></a><a href=#001136>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=00h11m36s">00:11:36</a></td> <td>Alex Evans</td> <td>And then finally, these models are really adaptable and modular, and it's easy to change their assumptions without really messing too much up.

In fact, I think it's a good exercise to try and go in and tweak some of these. We can have really any unit of analysis here. We can use individual broad transactions. We can have a discrete state space, continuous state space. This state space's a bigger one. A smaller one actually in the next slide. I think I'll contract the state space a little bit.

Do you see a scenario where secondary lending platforms basically half the effective DAI supply that would have been if they didn't exist at all? I'm trying to think of the right way to formulate the question because I look at Compound and it's a $20 million DAI market, right? That's a quarter of the total DAI supply. I don't know.

One is people who sort of capitulated there's CPs and sold their DAI and have no intent in reclaiming that DAI at least for quite a while or to the extent that people are holding onto DAI for some reason and have not decided to refinance.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010749></a><a href=#010749>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h07m49s">01:07:49</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But I don't expect that to be significant portion of the supply on those platforms. I think it will primarily be purchased DAI that is being supplied, but the borrow volume is fairly significant. It's like 18 million, but as of four days ago it was 11 million. And then, as of seven days ago it was roughly that and it hasn't changed for quite a while. It was 7 million in June 19<sup>th</sup>. It's kind of been slowly and steadily increasing except for in the last four of five days which is again partly due to UI improvements, partly due to stability fee. But a dYdX borrow volume, for example, has actually gone down a little bit, but [crosstalk 01:08:51].</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010850></a><a href=#010850>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h08m50s">01:08:50</a></td> <td>David Utrobin</td> <td>So about dYdX borrow volume, is that because the people that actually use the supply DAI on dYdX are using it specifically for dYdX instruments and not just pure borrowing like on Compound?

What's the difference?"

Although those have actually come down fairly significantly, but they're definitely more unpredictable rates. You've seen the utilization come down pretty ... I'm sorry, I'm looking at a graph here at [Sunfair 01:09:55].

I think part of the reason is education in UI, so UI's not to be underestimated. Definitely I think there were some people who were borrowing from dYdX at a higher rate and then realized they could get a lower rate on Compound and decided to switch. That I'm sure is part of the impact.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011031></a><a href=#011031>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h10m31s">01:10:31</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But also I think dYdX is in large part going to be used for like leveraged long positions and for derivative structures. And so, I think there were a fair amount of people who'd kind of given up on long positions and probably thus disproportionately affect the borrow on dYdX versus other platforms. Because I think dYdX has it's brand and it's going to be more used more expensive short term plays or at least more unpredictable shorter term plays that probably are for a greater degree of leverage, like going directly 3X or something.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011113></a><a href=#011113>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h11m13s">01:11:13</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>With dYdX UIs has the easiest method of going directly to a 3X leverage long position.

I think it actually probably an economic positive because what was happening with that supply if it wasn't being borrowed on Compound? It's not like people are drawing DAI out now to just go lend it on Compound because that makes no economic sense. If people are that will go down over time as people smarten up, but I don't think that's a reasonable explanation at this point.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011203></a><a href=#011203>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h12m03s">01:12:03</a></td> <td>David Utrobin</td> <td>Right.

The problem is if that supply starts to decrease. This is where I talk about quote/unquote bone on bone. If that supply starts to decrease because demand starts to decrease and people want to start using USDC or something else, that's when I think you should be concerned.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011339></a><a href=#011339>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h13m39s">01:13:39</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And so, you don't want the stability fee to be 50% because then you're self selecting to where only people who are going insanely levered and are really into going levered on DAI would use the system.

And then, it starts to become a really complex psychological equation of had it been increased only to 19% instead of 19.5 would people have been less overreactionary to dropping it to 16.5 creating less of a need to 20.5 or 22 for that matter?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011539></a><a href=#011539>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wScyBRdLwE&t=01h15m39s">01:15:39</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>And so, it's like you have to really visualize how these things play out because you could create your problems.
