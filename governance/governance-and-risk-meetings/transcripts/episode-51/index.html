Brown</td> <td>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the September 51th edition of the scientific governance and risk meeting. My name is Richard Brown. I'm the head of community development at MakerDAO. In these calls, we are enormously interested in everything that the community has to say, particularly people that are willing to come up to these calls. So if you have a question or a comment, please, please, please, please, I'm begging you, type it in the chat at the side or wherever your UI happens to have placed it. Or if you have access to a microphone, please do not feel shy about getting on the mic and interrupting us. We interrupt each other all the time. There's no reason why the community should not do it, as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000042></a><a href=#000042>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h00m42s">00:00:42</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Today, we have a new spin on the agenda which is possible going to be a sign of things to come. Historically, these meetings have been about governance and then they were about governance and risk. And soon, they are going to be about governance, risk, and oracles. And soon after that, they're going to be other things, as well. We are going to be having some conversations about how to optimize these calls, how to break them up, how to organize them. I'm hesitant to do that up front, because I'm sure that we've all had the same experience where trying to pre-plan your Slack meeting room organization long before you have enough reason to fill up those rooms is fraught with peril. I don't want to fragment these calls before we know that it's time to fragment them. But some time in the future, we might be splitting these [inaudible 00:01:37]. In the meantime, though, it's going to be action packed. And these calls are going to have a lot more variety than we had in the future, which might be nice. It might be overwhelming. We'll see how it goes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000147></a><a href=#000147>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h01m47s">00:01:47</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I am going to talk a bit about governance. LongForWisdom is going to tell us a bit about what's been happening on the ground in governance, which is the forums for us. All governance happens in the forums, lots of activity in there.

So Nik, our head of back-end services, is going to tell us about how we're going to deal with oracles in the future in sort of open-sourcy, governance world that we live in now. Looking forward to that. We're going to hear from Vishesh. He's going to tell us about the state of the peg. And then depending on interest and time, we'll stick around for a half hour or so and just answer some general Q&amp;A or do some general Q&amp;A.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000241></a><a href=#000241>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h02m41s">00:02:41</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>One of the things that I've been falling down on, ironically ... I don't know if I'm using that correctly, but this is a scientific governance and risk call. Very rarely do we actually talk about the polls and the results in the polls in governance, and we should probably start doing that. Recently, the community has signaled its intention and actually acted on its intention to lower the stability fee, which is a very interesting and encouraging behavior that Maker holders are not viciously self-interested people that are trying to scrape every last fee of the system. We're actually all enormously interested in maintaining stability of the peg. And if that means the stability fee needs to go down, it needs to go down. And the community jumped on that on our last vote.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000333></a><a href=#000333>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h03m33s">00:03:33</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>There's another stability fee poll that ended six minutes ago, which signaled the community's intention to lower another 2%, which is very interesting because ... I'm not a financial analyst. When it comes to crypto, I barely know what I'm doing, at least when it comes to watching charts. But it seems to have been presient because the peg was over a dollar and got even more of a deviation there in the last couple days. And who knows why? Maybe Vishesh will tell us. And so I won't steal his thunder and he can explain all of that to us.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000411></a><a href=#000411>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h04m11s">00:04:11</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We also have two interesting polls in the system right now. These are ... I sort of dramatically refer to them as watershed moments in the history of MakerDAO governance. Maybe that was a bit too much. But we are on a long road to decentralization. And the way that that works is we need to bootstrap systems and positions, rolls, responsibilities, processes in the ecosystem, and fund those positions and rolls and processes and the creation of those things. And then eventually, hand these things off to the community. The first role that we had with that model were the risk teams, obviously. The second role with that model is the governance facilitator, which is essentially what I've been doing in these calls for the last 51 meetings. And the next one up to bat is the oracle teams. We need to expose some levers there and some responsibilities to the governance ecosystem for eventual decentralization.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000515></a><a href=#000515>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h05m15s">00:05:15</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Each one of these roles are prototypes that we're using to bootstrap the DAO ecosystem. Over time, once these roles have been nailed down and processes are in place, actors from the ecosystem hopefully will arrive and they will begin to assume some of these responsibilities. For example, the governance facilitator essentially is me. In a very near future ... I shouldn't say very. Who knows what that actually even looks like. But post MCD, the next six to twelve months, who knows? It would be absolutely stellar if there was two or three other governance facilitators that could work with me and more governance facilitators, and then I can back away from the system completely and then the community could take over.

In the tech world, if you've build something and put it on the internet, you're expected to defend that thing against the ecosystem that you've released it into. There's this interesting overlap with how DeFi, in the crypto space, is emerging. And it's coming from a technical perspective as opposed to a traditional finance perspective.

And I think we should continue that conversation, but I also think we should note that it's fine if we say both strategies are important. The thing is, they're two diverging sets of tactics. So the same tactics wouldn't necessarily apply to getting the top 50 whales versus to getting a thousand Maker holders, period. And that's really what I was trying to get at there. So if we do continue in sort of this deadlock fashion, I think that's actually great because it means that we realize that both of those sides are important and we just need different sets of tactics for each side, which I'm going to continue to work on as far as video content and social media goes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=001248></a><a href=#001248>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h12m48s">00:12:48</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Yeah, I agree completely.

It's actually human nature, but everybody wants underdog to win or they're looking at the voting system and they say, "Voting equals representative democracy," and so there's this dichotomy that people need to work through. But you're right. Personally, I like to see both. I like to see thousands of curls and minnows and ... I can't remember what the scale is ... to attempt to offset the whales in the system to spice things up a bit, I guess. Get a bit of variety in there. But it also shows us an interesting metric that I'm super keen on, which is do we see different voting behaviors based on the amounts of Maker that people possess.

We need to know if positions are sufficiently collateralized. And if they're not, then they can be liquidated.

So it's time to throw some more stuff at you. And so part of making the oracles more decentralized is to make sure that, instead of us being kind of in the driver's seat and making all the decisions, that it's actually you guys who make all the decisions.

Now that terminology might seem a bit foreign to some of you. So what is the difference between a feed and an oracle? Well, feed is an individual who is running a bot that is pushing price updates for an asset, versus the oracle is the actual smart contract onchain that other smart contracts can query for the price. So when you basically group together a set of feeds, the onchain price that you see in the oracle is actually the median of all of those feed inputs. That means that we're placing a lot of trust in feeds to be good actors and not ... They have the ability to launch an oracle attack, which would be catastrophic. I'm sure I don't have to tell you.

We're going to need an oracle for REP and we're going to need to define the rule set around REP, right? What exchanges are we querying? What asset pairs from those exchanges are we querying?

So for example, one of them is the sensitivity parameter. And this is basically, what percent spread do you want to have before you update the oracle? If you, say, have a 2% sensitivity, then if the price changes 1%, then the oracle price will not change. It's going to wait for that threshold. The lower you have the sensitivity, the more, quote-on-quote, "sensitive," your oracle will be to prices changes. However, it also gets very expensive because you're doing updates more often, more often, more often, more often and each of those are consuming gas costs, it can add up very quick, especially when the network is congested and all of a sudden you have 60 Gwei transactions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=002548></a><a href=#002548>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h25m48s">00:25:48</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>Another angle here is expiration. So the price expires after a certain set of time, right? Another one we have is the delay. So in MCD, the oracle value is fed into a smart contract called the oracle security module. And the oracle security module is there to protect MCD from oracle attacks. So it acts as kind of the buffer in between the oracle and the MCD system. And the way that it acts as this buffer is that it has a delay. So let's say the delay is one hour, right?

So it's been myself, maybe you guys have heard of Mariano, Mariano Conti, and a handful of other people who have been really instrumental in making sure that this all runs to perfection and the house doesn't burn down.

If there is a new collateral asset that is added, the tools need to be updated to support that new asset and then that update that needs to be pushed out to all the different feeds. If we wanted to have a new asset added, we need to deploy the oracle smart contracts. So that is kind of infrastructure deployment and then someone needs to verify that running a bunch of tests to make sure that not only are the smart contracts correct as published, but in the way that they're configured and deployed, that everything is correct there as well.

What pairs on those exchanges should it grab the price from? Once it has this set of prices, what is the filtering, modeling mechanism that it uses to arrive at a final price? So these are all questions that we have to think about, whether we want to have a generalized framework for every asset to follow or whether we kind of define subclasses and say, well, these types of tokens should be handled this way and these types of tokens should be handled this way, right? So maybe something that's low volume that has very low liquidity needs to be handled very differently from something that has very high liquidity.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=003220></a><a href=#003220>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h32m20s">00:32:20</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So Rich, I can't actually see the chat.

So actually, feeds was the next thing I'm going to talk about. And one of the first things I'm going to talk about is why individuals in organizations kind of have different game theory play out.

If you go to MakerDAO.com/feeds, you'll see a very, very sexy dashboard that shows what the oracle price is and it'll show the address and price and timestamp of every single feed that went into constructing that price. So the oracle price that we have right now, the model is that it is the median of all of the feeds. Feeds are compensated. They're paid monthly. And currently, the foundation is footing the bill for that. This is the first time that we're kind of publicly talking about this, but the feeds have been paid about a thousand DAI per month and that's to kind of cover their expenses in terms of infrastructure and to cover their time for promptly addressing any kind of situations that pop up or promptly installing updates and upgrades.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004147></a><a href=#004147>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h41m47s">00:41:47</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>But eventually, it's not sustainable that this comes from the foundation.

Here is an alternative, right? Here are these organizations, these groups of people. And I made the case that these groups of people should be public. And I think there is a lot of good reasons why. I think groups of people are much harder to coerce, extort, and bribe. They're much more resistant. And another thing that comes into play here is their reputation. So you have this idea of reputation of individuals versus reputation of organizations.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004510></a><a href=#004510>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h45m10s">00:45:10</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So let's take Mariano, for example. Mariano has been very public that he is a feed. I think he's the only person who has been public about it. If Mariano decides to launch an oracle attack one day, which is that his feed just starts pushing BS prices, Mariano is just some dude in Argentina who's going to be laughing at a bunch of people on the internet being mad at him. When you have something, say 0x, which is an organization based out of San Francisco with a reputation that they need to protect, that they value, because their livelihood depends on their product being successful, their reputation is worth a lot more to them than Mariano's reputation is worth to him. So for an organization to run a feed, it's actually more advantageous to force that organization to be public exactly because they start to put their reputation at stake and their reputation has real value.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=004627></a><a href=#004627>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h46m27s">00:46:27</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Can I come in for a second with a question?

So another way that reputation factors in is trust by users. So one of the biggest complaints about our oracles has been, "Oh, well, there's this group of 14 or 15 Maker insiders," or whatever, "and they could kill the system at any time they wanted. Why won't they tell us who they are?" To an extent, I understand that criticism but, because of the reasons I said earlier for why they have to stay anonymous, that's basically my response. But since organizations have reputation, their users will inherently trust our oracles more if they know that 0x is running one of the feeds, if they know the dYdX is running one of the feeds, if they know that Dharma is running one of the feeds, if they know that Chainlink is running one of the feeds. So there is an argument to be made here that reputation is hugely beneficial, a public reputation is hugely beneficial when it comes to organizations.

They've been using our BTC oracle, which is running on the oracle's V2 stack since back in February, I believe. So that is a long time and they helped us iron out a lot of kinks in the system so it'd be ready to go for Multi-Collateral DAI. dYdX has been using our oracle's V1 from day one. 0X has been using us, as well, for some eternal stuff they've been working on. And Gnosis has been using us for their DutchX auction platform.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005422></a><a href=#005422>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h54m22s">00:54:22</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So this is as much about bringing in already existing stakeholders in the ecosystem, right? Stakeholders who are using the oracles and therefore have an incentive to, again, be a good feed, in that respect.

So this one is a little bit controversial, I think, from what I've seen in response to the community. But I think if you think about it, it's going to make a lot of sense.

And what this is all about is basically creating a balanced model of aligned incentives for all the different stakeholders in the oracle ecosystem to make the oracle infrastructure self-sustainable and more decentralized.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005549></a><a href=#005549>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h55m49s">00:55:49</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So the key feature here that people will probably notice is that, in oracle's V2, our oracles will be whitelisted. And what this means is that each oracle smart contract will have a whitelist that regulates who is allowed to read the prices from that oracle. So if you want to use, say, the ETH/USD oracle, you need to be on the oracle whitelist. And so this is a tool for governance and for MKR holders, in general, to effectively monetize the oracle infrastructure. Because I think what you're going to find is that when eventually this transition of, rather than the development fund paying feeds and it going to stability fees instead, then as we up the numbers of feeds, as we up the numbers of oracles, you're going to find that the costs get pretty, pretty high. And having this tool in our tool belts, should we want to use it to recoup some of those costs, I think can be very beneficial.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005711></a><a href=#005711>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h57m11s">00:57:11</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>One thing to note here is that maybe the whitelist isn't used for monetization right away.

And then they come to us and they're like, "You know what? We'll list all of our tokens against DAI if you give us oracle prices." So that can be another way for governance to then leverage, say, the utility of what their oracles provide and actually get something out of it, as well.

The whitelist does not strengthen the peg or increase the utility of DAI. My bad. So one thing that I want to talk about is, how do we create an incentive, this kind of incentive system? And how would that actually empower us to do different things? So when I say that people on the whitelist may have to pay to read those prices, who are they paying? Well, they're paying the MKR holders because it's all about having this virtual alignment of all the different incentives. So if MKR holders are figuratively paying feeds who are pushing prices to oracles which are providing services for customers and the customers are then paying MKR holders, you have this kind of virtual circle.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005913></a><a href=#005913>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=00h59m13s">00:59:13</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>And because you have this, you have something really cool.

So proposal 4.5. this is kind of a continuation of what we just talked about in terms of the whitelist. The smart contracts out of the box will come with a whitelist, but I don't actually think governance should use the whitelist right away. And there is a lot of reasons for this. The first is that our oracles, right now, we're one of the first in the Ethereum ecosystem. And they were organically adopted in a lot of different places. So much so that we don't even know all of the different infrastructure that is dependent on our oracles. We could possibly cause a chain reaction.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010210></a><a href=#010210>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h02m10s">01:02:10</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So one of the reasons for the whitelist, to begin with, is the fact that we can actually map out who is using our oracles and see these kind of chains of risk building up and being aware of them. So seeing who is using them and how are they being used. So flipping the switch and all of a sudden saying, "Nope, you don't get oracles anymore, there's a whitelist now," that could potentially have catastrophic effects. So I would exercise caution and I would like to, before this proposal, that anyone who wants to join the whitelist for any oracle, current and future, can get access for free for one year.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010306></a><a href=#010306>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h03m06s">01:03:06</a></td> <td>Niklas Kunkel</td> <td>So this kind of makes sure that we don't pull the rug out from underneath anyone, we don't set off anyone scrambling to come up with some shitty oracle solution in a one-month span.

There's a good reason to have it be free, though. That's not just having to do with being a good actor and kind of thinking of the ecosystem. We can kind of be greedy at the same time and say, "Well, we have this infrastructure and we want people to use it."

Okay. So I'll just start off with the most interesting thing. So essentially, with the two relatively rapid drops in the stability fee, the borrow rates on Compound, dYdX on a weighted average basis ... I kind of tracked down with that. So essentially, at 20.5, which was sitting there for, say, over a month, that borrow rate started to come down a little bit on those platforms. With the upcoming drop to 18.5%, there's a little bit of an uptick in activity. And then the rates kind of tracked a little. And then again with the 16.5% drop, we have an uptick in activity. And then the rates, again, track. So this is kind of a pattern we've noticed when the stability fee moves, sort of how these borrow rates respond accordingly to basically maintain a somewhat healthy point or two-point buffer, which occasionaly drifts to, say, maybe three, three and a half when there's low utilization and the rate is very high. Or maybe a point when the rate is dropped and utilization is sort of tracking.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010724></a><a href=#010724>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h07m24s">01:07:24</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So as far as the borrow volumes ... So during that same time period, borrow volume, if you see in the last week or two, has risen a bit more for dYdX and a very slight dip for Compound. So compound has been more or less steady with a very slight dip and then dYdX did experience a little bit of a bump with those rate drops. I think part of that has to do with the fact that there were slightly different use cases for dYdX versus Compound. And as those rates get cheaper, you may see people essentially attempting to engage in a bit more fancy footwork in terms of the derivative structures that they try to construct out of the borrowing [inaudible 01:08:08].</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010808></a><a href=#010808>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h08m08s">01:08:08</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Hopping over to supply volumes, essentially that has been consistently rising over the past couple months. That was rising a bit more, again, for dYdX recently than for Compound. Compound basically came out one to two million and that tracked a little bit with the drop in the stability fee. It was actually a longer-term, steady increase. So again, this excess supply kind of went hand in hand with that although it was increasing a bit more dramatically. So essentially, there's been a bit lower utilisation on these platforms, recently. And so you can see that here.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010853></a><a href=#010853>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h08m53s">01:08:53</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>The utilization rates for Compound came down pretty significantly for when the rates were kind of close to touching the stability fee to now back around that sort of 70, 75% range which, in the longer term ... I wish I'd shown the longer-term scale here ... is a bit of a steady state. It seems, for Compound, it doesn't generally dip below this sort of 70% level. And dYdX, again, a little bit all over the place, a little bit more unpredictable, but still in that 70 to 80% range, which it has been pretty consistently.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010929></a><a href=#010929>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h09m29s">01:09:29</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So at the end of the day, just a little bit more supply on Compound for basically similar borrowing volumes, which is pretty interesting considering that the stability fee rates have dropped down. So essentially, if you think about this as the stability fee being, quote-on-quote, "too high," and you think of the utilisation on compound as being not artificially propped up, but more of a short-term increase ... and again, we talked about some of the impact of InstaDapp refinancings and things like that. But as it came down to a little bit more of a steady level, then this just became a little bit more of a constant despite the drops in stability fee. So that just means the rates kind of track with that. Demand levels didn't move very much and neither did supply levels, which is kind of why those rates, coming back to here, basically just maintained that buffer because, as it's cheaper to borrow DAI on Maker, then you have fewer refinancings. So a little bit less increase in borrow volume on platforms like compound. Because if there's a one point difference in the rates, maybe some people trust the Maker contracts more or something like that, and so they decided to just keep their CDP positions on Maker.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011056></a><a href=#011056>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h10m56s">01:10:56</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So that's what you kind of see reflected in this pie graph. So essentially, this supply has been comparatively steady for a little while now. It, interestingly enough, took a slight dip on the 28<sup>th</sup>. So essentially, there is a large quantity of DAI that was wiped on the 28<sup>th</sup>, but there wasn't sort of a commensurate refinancing, to secondary lending platforms. So it wasn't so much, I think, refinancing as just a little bit of capitulation of leverage positions, because that overall supply did come down. So essentially, this was when ETH crossed the 170 line, I believe it was. So presumably, some people just had kind of a hard line at 170 bucks for ETH and decided to close out some leverage positions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011147></a><a href=#011147>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h11m47s">01:11:47</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But similarly, some leverage positions were opened up with the news of the drop in stability fee and then again with the most recent drop. There was a little bit more debt taken out, but not enough to really cancel out the amount that was wiped. So essentially, part of the question earlier was, okay, why is DAI price still up despite the stability fee having been dropped? Generally, we expect more debt to be drawn out and so more DAI on the market and a bit of a drop in price. And the answer is ultimately because there was not a commensurate increase in DAI supply. So that, presumably, is an indicator that either two things happened to cancel out at the exact same time or the rates were just too high for the demand levels that were out there.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011243></a><a href=#011243>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h12m43s">01:12:43</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>As far as collateral ... In collateral terms ... In ETH terms, this collateral has been pretty steady. There was a bit of an increase in the amount of collateral at the same time that dropped below 170 ETH price. But in dollar terms, that's actually come down a little bit. So that's something I can show you, as well. In dollar terms, the collateral value has been slightly, slowly decreasing, but more or less steady. And then in nominal ETH terms, that has been pretty counter-active to the drops in ITH price. So essentially, people are just managing that buffer level of collateralization that they're comfortable with, which is something that you see time and time again.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011334></a><a href=#011334>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h13m34s">01:13:34</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So no significant amount of bites recently. So essentially, kind of oddly quiet despite the drops in stability fee, which can, I think, be used as evidence for consistent, slow decreases.

I mean, comparatively low trading volumes. So you see this, as well, transaction volume has been down a little bit this past month. So I think there is a little bit of a dip in both trading and transaction volume, general activity. And so that's really interesting that the price has stayed up a little bit despite that dip in usage. And so, in the last 24 hours, there's been 1.6 million roughly traded under these exchanges for ETH. That is relatively low and so, take this with a grain of salt, but the price has been kind of hovering in this 1.5% above a dollar range.

There's still a lack of clarity around whether exposing this button for people to press is incentivizing them to press a button because a button has been presented to them or whether there is pros and cons with just putting a bit of a rate limit around this thing by exposing the vote every two weeks, and see how that works. That needs to get brought to the floor again.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012142></a><a href=#012142>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h21m42s">01:21:42</a></td> <td>LongForWisdom</td> <td>Yeah.

It's fairly well defined at this point. So there's ideally, I brought the cadence and the exponential thing from Reddit and re-posted it into the forums and then in the forums, it got re-posted into another forum. We're getting some murkiness on where these things arise and maintaining conversations. But ideally, I think that it'd be good to have a brand-new, clean forum post that says, "Here's an encapsulation of all the thinking up until this date about the cadence." Then specify, "Here is the seven or 20, 14 or whatever days that we are going to spend discussing it. And at the end of 14 days or seven days, there will be a poll and then that poll will last for whatever," and then after that, it goes into the governance thing. So I think that there's value in repeating those same steps for everything before it hits the governance poll so that people know what to expect and they don't go on holidays and come back and find out that there was a five-day governance poll that there weren't expecting.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=012318></a><a href=#012318>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=01h23m18s">01:23:18</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We are at a half hour into the Q&amp;A session.
