Welcome to the August 22<sup>nd</sup> edition of the Scientific Governance and Risk Meeting. My name is Richard Brown. I am the Head of our Community Development and MakerDAO, we have lots to go over today. I say it every single time, but it's true every single time, so I'll keep on doing it.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000020></a><a href=#000020>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h00m20s">00:00:20</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>We are enormously interested in hearing from people in this room.

I'll try and figure out how much of Q&amp;A we need to get through, because I'm the conference facilitator of things. See if there's any interest in getting through that a bit at the top. Bob Wisdom, or LongForWisdom to his friends who will be giving us a brief recap of what's happening in the forums and governance in the last week.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000104></a><a href=#000104>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h01m04s">00:01:04</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Cyrus from the risk team will review the risk team mandate, which is another large documents in the same vein as the governance facilitator mandate, that went into the forums recently. He'll walk us through that and we'll hear from Vishesh, and he will tell us what crypto has been up to and what the peg looks like, and actually Matthew, I haven't confirmed with you. But if Matthew has a weekly narrative for us, we'll be talking about that as well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000132></a><a href=#000132>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h01m32s">00:01:32</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>So let's jump into things almost immediately. I don't have another speech prepared or a document I want to review, but I do want to just at the top of the hour open the floor to see whether there's questions that people have about the governance facilitator role and whether I can address some of them immediately. Yeah. Well, let's do that right now. If anybody has any questions about the governance facilitator role about the conversation that's been happening in the forums, about any specific item let me know. In the absence of that, and I know it can be a bit intimidating to be the first one to do it. In the absence of that, I might just open up the threads, run through it and see if there are things that we could address.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=000219></a><a href=#000219>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h02m19s">00:02:19</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I woke up this morning to a significant amount of interaction in there and I haven't had a chance to reading it yet.

If a risk team were to be voted in, would it make sense for them to just be able to go and submit any risk parameters from there on forward? Obviously not.

That's again, another reason why risk teams by themselves will not have arbitrary power, right? Because for example, let's say we were to onboard a specialist for just for crypto assets such as ETH and then two months later they say they want to start evaluating stocks or other traditional assets.

Right. And from here, this is where we're identifying or envisioning two separate tracks.

So big picture, I mean, ETH price has been down a bit lately. It took a sharp jump back down around the 15<sup>th</sup>. So what's happened is in collateral terms, so obviously in the total dollar value of collateral has gone down over the course of the past two, three weeks, somewhat significantly, but in nominal terms we can look at that same amount of collateral. It's been a little bit more flat. So just to touch on that a little bit, essentially with that drop in ETH price, there was also more collateral that was added into the system, which is as we've seen many times now a fairly predictable reaction. People get scared when price drops and liquidations occur, and so they add in a bit more collateral as a hedge against the risk of further liquidation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005436></a><a href=#005436>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h54m36s">00:54:36</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>In DAI terms, I mean, the supply has been relatively steady around in between 76 and 78-ish million. And so we saw essentially a few draws and wipes, but essentially more or less balancing out over the last couple of weeks so that overall DAI supply has actually been relatively steady. Those two have a good graph on that but yeah, the DAI's price has been relatively steady during that time frame.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005514></a><a href=#005514>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h55m14s">00:55:14</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>What has been going on with DAI? So over the last seven days, essentially the trading volume has been relatively low, so averaging up to again around 2 million per day. In the last 24 hours, it was about 1.6 so these are relatively low levels of trading activity. The price has been sitting slightly above a dollar over the last seven days and same is true over the last 24 hours, so it was a little bit higher a few days ago. And then in the last 24, 48 hours has come down slightly, but again, still slightly above a dollar. So, all in all pretty stable even despite ETH making significant moves, so we have not seen a significant amount of re-leveraging with that drop in ETH price though in terms of, as shown earlier in terms of collateralization ratio, the risk has gone up a bit because that collateralization ratio has come down though the amount of debt has not changed significantly in that time frame.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005632></a><a href=#005632>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h56m32s">00:56:32</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So yeah, all in all not a ton of activity with DAI and Maker despite a fair amount of activity with ETH, which is fairly predictable given that the amount of leveraging behavior has been comparatively low lately, so it's unclear whether some of those highly risky CDP owners have halted that behavior or if they're waiting for the price to come down even more before getting back in a leveraged level. So it will be interesting to watch and see what happens, but again, at the current levels the stability fee, it's been a point of discussion I think a bit on the chats.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005728></a><a href=#005728>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h57m28s">00:57:28</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So just to touch on that briefly I mean, essentially the drawing and wiping activity has not been significantly impacted by the price movements in ETH. So, as has been previously discussed, that stability fee is effectively a modifying variable that impacts the relationship between what happens with DAI supply and what's going on with ETH price as an input. And so, given that that amount of sensitivity has been comparatively low lately, effectively it means the stability fee is if it were to be lowered slightly, I don't imagine it would have a hugely significant impact on the DAI price.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005817></a><a href=#005817>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h58m17s">00:58:17</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>There is a case to be made that given the lower levels of demands that it may be reasonable to lower that stability fee slightly. One other data point was so ... and I would encourage ignoring this spikes, so essentially the rates on dYdX did shoot up for a day and that was somewhat interesting, but to explain that in a minute. Essentially the rates the weighted average were and supply rates have been more or less steady. They've come down a little bit since some of that hype at the end of July with InstaDapp, with the changes in how Compound was working but has nestled back into that like, two to three point spread between the weighted average rate and their stability fee at least for the borrow rate, the supply rate has come down a little bit to know around 11, 12%.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=005922></a><a href=#005922>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=00h59m22s">00:59:22</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>So this is only showing since beginning of July here, but that's basically a steady state supply rate when not much is going on in terms of borrow volumes for Compounds and even dYdX. The dYdX these rates are a little bit less predictable. So that borrow volume ticked up slightly over the past few days, but more or less has been pretty steady. The supply volume has continued to increase a bit although that increase has been a little bit slower on Compound than dYdX over the past week or so.

So for dYdX, that excess supply had been continuing to grow but took a pretty decent dip. So that's where a lot of those, the rate jumps came from, is that dip in the excess supply, so essentially probably just a large refinancing or large movement or large play by a few players on dYdX, because those overall volumes are pretty low. So a few large power users can move those numbers around fairly significantly.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010049></a><a href=#010049>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=01h00m49s">01:00:49</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>For Compound there was also commensurate dip in the excess supply. But if you actually think about it in percentage terms, it's not that huge. Right? So we were at 9.6 is the peak there and it dipped down to about 7.6 whereas dYdX is dip down to about 2.3 ... oh sorry. Yeah, dip down to about 1.9 in excess supply around that same time frame. Again, this is just shown it a little bit clearer fashion, so the utilization rate on Compound is coming down quite a bit since that spike that we discussed to about 75, 78%, which is a pretty steady state for Compound I feel.

It does mean that the buffer that exists on the secondary lending platforms is still just sitting there. But given what's been going on with the DAI supply, I think it's actually a more reasonable interpretation that through liquidations and through some people abandoning their positions, there was a decent amount of DAI that made its way onto the market that was actually probably picked up by traders, arbitrators, people that are looking to lend that DAI out for you in a relatively risk neutral fashion. I think that's where a lot of this excess supply is actually coming from, so it's curious what would cause this DAI to recirculate and be paid back into the loans that it originated from because if you draw the links out it has to come from somewhere, and so there are CDPs that are sitting out there open that are recurring interest on the negative area under this curve.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010316></a><a href=#010316>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=01h03m16s">01:03:16</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>It's going to be interesting to see at what point this actually circulates because clearly a 20.5% stability fee is not enough to prompt that and so that's what leads me to believe that these are potentially just completely capitulated loan positions where the CDP owner has written them off and has little to no intent to pay it back and may even just want to get liquidated to get out of the position. It's hard to really speculate as to what people are thinking with regards to CDP management. The point of that is this does not necessarily mean that the stability fee has to stay at 20.5%, and this is where sometimes we get into trouble by thinking a little bit too simply.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010409></a><a href=#010409>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=01h04m09s">01:04:09</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>But I know in the past we've really discussed a lot of this idea of, okay, well, if there's excess supply then it can reasonably be interpreted that that excess supply is oversupply and so if there is oversupply, then you should not lower the stability fee because there is DAI sitting out there that's not being consumed, and so demand levels are being outpaced by supply levels. That is potentially still true but I do think we ought to think a little bit differently about cases where that DAI is sourced from CDPs, that a CDP owner may have potentially given up on, and this DAI is now actually held by traders who have just picked it up on the market and in which case this may not actually necessarily speak to the "over supply level" or by extension indirectly the demand level. So we may have to get a little bit more refined our thinking here to really understand whether it makes sense to lower the stability fee. But my inclination is that it would not be out of the realm of reason to lower it by half a percent or maybe a full percent.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=010530></a><a href=#010530>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=01h05m30s">01:05:30</a></td> <td>Vishesh Choudhry</td> <td>Okay.

Actually, let me do it now.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011602></a><a href=#011602>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=01h16m02s">01:16:02</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>Limited utility possibly. Well, people should be familiar enough with it. So head at forum.makerdao.com And at the very top there you'll find a link to the discussion thread specific to this call and in the next hour or two we'll be posting links to the audio and the video. Summaries will be coming soon, and that's the place to continue the discussion and ask questions that weren't answered.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a name=011629></a><a href=#011629>#</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNxehraB0o&t=01h16m29s">01:16:29</a></td> <td>Richard Brown</td> <td>I think that is it for today.
